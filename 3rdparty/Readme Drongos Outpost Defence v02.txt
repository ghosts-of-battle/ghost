Requirements
============
Arma 3
CBA for Arma 3: http://www.armaholic.com/page.php?id=18767

Overview
========
This module generates waves of attackers trying to overrun a position held by the players. It works in SP and coop. The players will win after either a set amount of time has passed or a certain number of enemies has been killed.

Setup
=====
Open the editor, press F5 and find "Drongo's Outpost Defence". Place a "Core" module in the location you wish to defend. Double click on the module to change options such as enemy side, squad size, etc. Using the editor, place any defensive structures and friendly units you desire.

By default, CSAT will spawn as the enemy. To change this, place enemy men and vehicles in a safe sector of the map, then sync them to the module. Any respawn, revive must be set by the mission editor. It is also suggested that "Mission fail when everyone is dead" is set in the editor (under Atrributes>Multiplayer>Respawn).
