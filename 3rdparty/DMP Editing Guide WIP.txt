Checking units:
Each unit will has text variables called dmpFaction and dmpAItype which can be checked by getVariable. For example

systemChat format["%1",(_unit getVariable"dmpAItype")];

or more robustly:

if!(isNil{_unit getVariable"dmpAItype"})then{systemChat format["%1",(_unit getVariable"dmpAItype")]};

HVTs have a variable called dmpIsHVT.

Traders have an array called dmpTraderInfo that holds all of their stock.


Useful variables:
dmpLocations:		array of positions of engine locations found with the nearestLocations command
dmpRemoteAreas:		array of generated markers of areas that are dmpRemoteDistance away from the above locations
dmpCompounds:		array of positions of compounds (compounds are 3 or more enterable buildings that are away from towns)
dmpBlacklist:		array of blacklisted positions
dmpOccupiedTowns:	array of positions that have an occupation force spawned on them
dmpPlayerCash:		number used for buying from traders

Useful functions:
dmp_fnc_GetHVTs:	[_position,_side] get an array of all HVT units on given side, ordered from closest to _position
dmp_fnc_GetCivilianLeaders:	[_position,_side] get an array of all civilian leader units, ordered from closest to _position
