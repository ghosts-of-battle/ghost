/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * Where the player is looking through a [Ghost] Vector, as an ASL position.
 *
 * ONE RAYCAST, TWO CONSUMERS. The shared target marker and the personal waypoint
 * both need the same answer, and two copies of a line-of-sight test are two
 * copies that can disagree about what "the target" is - one taking a building
 * face and the other the ground behind it.
 *
 * IT TAKES THE NEARER OF TWO HITS. lineIntersectsSurfaces finds objects and
 * building faces; terrainIntersectAtASL finds the ground, which the first does
 * not. Whichever is closer to the eye is what the player is actually looking at,
 * and taking the object hit unconditionally is how a Vector aimed over a wall
 * lands its marker on the wall.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * None
 *
 * Return Value:
 * 0: Target position ASL, [] for nothing in range <ARRAY>
 * 1: Range in metres <NUMBER>
 *
 * Example:
 * ([] call ghost_equipment_fnc_vectorTarget) params ["_posASL", "_range"]
 *
 * Public: No
