#include "script_component.hpp"
/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * Drops a personal waypoint on whatever the Vector is looking at.
 *
 * PERSONAL MEANS LOCAL, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT OF IT BESIDE THE TARGET
 * MARKER. The target marker is a report - it goes to everybody and it stays.
 * This is a note to yourself: nobody else sees it, it costs the section's map
 * nothing, and you can drop one on every corner of a route without filling
 * their screen with your working.
 *
 * ONE AT A TIME. A man navigating has one place he is going to. Dropping a
 * second moves the first rather than adding to it, which also means the key
 * never needs a delete of its own.
 *
 * AIMING AT IT AGAIN CLEARS IT. Within fifteen metres counts as the same place -
 * a toggle a man can actually hit through a rangefinder at four hundred metres.
 * Pressing with nothing in view clears it too, which is the fallback for a
 * waypoint set somewhere you can no longer see.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * None
 *
 * Return Value:
 * Handled <BOOL>
 *
 * Example:
 * call ghost_equipment_fnc_placeWaypoint
