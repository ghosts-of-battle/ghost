/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * Reads one CAS module and puts the asset it describes on the board.
 *
 * MANY MODULES, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE. The enemy-drone module refuses a
 * second placement because a second would arm one system twice. This is the
 * opposite case: a module IS an airframe, so two modules are two aircraft and
 * a mission that wants a flight of three places three. Nothing here is
 * global state - every value read below lands on the logic it came from.
 *
 * WHOSE IT IS COMES FROM Ghost - Core, NOT FROM AN ATTRIBUTE (D59). Adding a
 * side field here would be a second place allegiance is typed, and the two
 * would disagree the first time a mission changed one of them.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: The module logic <OBJECT>
 * 1: Synchronised units <ARRAY>
 * 2: Activated <BOOL>
 *
 * Return Value: None
 *
 * Public: No
