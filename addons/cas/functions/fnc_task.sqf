#include "script_component.hpp"
/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * Takes one order from the support page and either flies it or says why not.
 *
 * THE SAME SIGNATURE THE ADAPTER'S TASKING USES, because the page calls
 * whichever provider owns the id without caring which one that is. Air
 * assets there read the first entries of the parameter array; this reads the
 * two that are its own.
 *
 * INGRESS AND EGRESS ARE PLACES, NOT HEADINGS. They were headings on a pair of
 * steppers, and a heading is a thing you have to convert in your head from the
 * map you are already looking at - the ridge you want the run behind is a
 * POINT, not 285 degrees. So both are picked the same way the target is: click
 * the map, or take a placed marker off the list. The aircraft appears at the
 * ingress point and leaves towards the egress point.
 *
 * EITHER MAY BE LEFT UNSET AND THE RUN STILL FLIES. Unset ingress means the
 * aircraft comes in from the caller's side of the target, which is the sane
 * default and the one a man in contact would ask for without thinking; unset
 * egress means it carries straight on through. Requiring three map picks
 * before anything could be called in would make the fast case slow.
 *
 * THE REFUSAL IS THE SAME QUESTION THE ROW ASKED. FUNC(available) answers
 * both, so a row that draws IDLE cannot be an order this then rejects.
 *
 * LOITER IS THE OTHER THING A DRONE IS FOR. The page has always offered it
 * beside the attack run and this addon flew both as a strike - an asset asked
 * to hold overhead put its bombs down and left. It is now its own task: the
 * aircraft holds an orbit over the point and the gunner's seat goes to the
 * drone controller who asked for it, so what happens next is a man on a
 * terminal rather than a script with a target list. See FUNC(request).
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Asset id, "ghostcas:<n>" <STRING>
 * 1: Task token <STRING> - "rtb" sends it home, "LOITER" holds it overhead the
 *    point, anything else is a strike on the point
 * 2: Target position <ARRAY> - the grid; terminal guidance may move it
 * 3: The support page's parameter array <ARRAY> - ingress POSITION at index 8,
 *    egress position at 9, [] for either meaning auto. Those two slots are past
 *    everything ALiVE's own tasking reads, so one array serves both kinds of
 *    asset and the page does not have to know which it is filling in.
 *
 * Return Value:
 * 0: Accepted <BOOL>
 * 1: Why not, "" when accepted <STRING>
 *
 * Public: No
