 * TERMINAL GUIDANCE: what the drone is actually going to hit, as opposed to
 * the grid it was sent to.
 *
 * THE GRID IS AN AREA, NOT A POINT. A ten-figure grid off a map click is
 * accurate to the pixel the man clicked, which over 4 km of run-in is a
 * building either side of the one he meant. So the request carries the grid
 * and the aircraft looks, on the way in, for somebody telling it better:
 *
 *   LASER first. A spot is unambiguous, it is aimed by a man who can see the
 *   target, and it is the only one of the three that can track something
 *   moving. Own side's spots only - an enemy designator is a trap.
 *
 *   SMOKE second. Every rifleman has it, it needs no equipment and no
 *   training, and it is what actually gets used when the JTAC is a section
 *   commander with a radio. Any colour: asking a man under fire to find the
 *   right grenade is asking for the strike to go in on nothing.
 *
 *   THE GRID LAST, unchanged. No spot and no smoke is not a failure - it is a
 *   map-grid strike, which is what was ordered, and it goes in.
 *
 * SEARCH RADIUS 0 TURNS THE WHOLE THING OFF, and the grid is final. A mission
 * that wants map-grid bombing and nothing cleverer sets that and gets it.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: The requested grid <ARRAY> - ATL
 * 1: Search radius in metres <NUMBER>
 * 2: The side asking <SIDE>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * 0: Aim point <ARRAY> - ATL
 * 1: What is guiding it <STRING> - "laser", "smoke" or "grid"
 * 2: The object to track, objNull for a fixed point <OBJECT>
 *
 * Public: No
