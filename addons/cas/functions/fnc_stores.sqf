 * Author: Ghost
 * What the airframe is actually carrying, in the words painted on the side of
 * it - one entry per store, heaviest first.
 *
 * THE PAGE USED TO OFFER CATEGORIES AND THE AIRCRAFT CARRIES OBJECTS. "BOMB /
 * MISSILE / ROCKET / GUN" is a taxonomy: it is the same five words over a
 * Reaper, a Bayraktar and a Buzzard, it cannot tell a GBU from a Scalpel when
 * an airframe has both, and it offers three kinds nothing aboard has ever
 * carried. A man calling a strike knows what his drone is hung with and asks
 * for THAT, so this reads the airframe's own stores and the page offers those.
 *
 * READ OFF THE CONFIG, NOT OFF THE AIRCRAFT, because the row is drawn while
 * the asset is still on the ground somewhere it does not exist - the aircraft
 * is created when the run is ordered. The class is what both ends share, so
 * the list the page shows and the list FUNC(task) indexes into are the same
 * list from the same read. An object may be passed instead and its live
 * loadout is used, which is what makes the answer honest for an airframe whose
 * pylons were rewritten after it spawned.
 *
 * BOTH PLACES ORDNANCE HIDES ARE READ. Turret magazines cover the gun and the
 * fixed-armament airframes; the pylon component covers everything with a
 * dynamic loadout, where the class's own magazines[] is empty and the default
 * fit lives one attachment at a time under Pylons.
 *
 * AIR-TO-AIR IS NOT ORDNANCE A SECTION IN CONTACT CAN USE. Anything the engine
 * marks as lockable on aircraft ONLY is dropped, so a UCAV carrying two
 * Falchions does not offer them to a man asking for a strike on a treeline.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Airframe class, or the aircraft itself <STRING|OBJECT>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * One entry per store, heaviest first <ARRAY>
 * 0: Magazine class <STRING>
 * 1: What to call it on the page <STRING>
 *
 * Public: No
