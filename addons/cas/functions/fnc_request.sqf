#include "script_component.hpp"
/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * One CAS run, server side: the aircraft appears on the ingress heading, flies
 * the target, releases, and leaves on the egress heading.
 *
 * THE GEOMETRY IS THE PLAYER'S AND IT IS THE WHOLE FEATURE. Ingress and egress
 * are POINTS ON THE MAP - the aircraft appears at the one and leaves towards
 * the other - so a section puts the run-in behind the ridge they are looking
 * at rather than converting it into a heading first. Either may be unset:
 * ingress then comes from the caller's side of the target, egress carries
 * straight on through.
 *
 * THE RUN-IN DISTANCE IS A FLOOR, NOT A FIXED RANGE. An ingress point dropped
 * two hundred metres off the target is an aircraft that appears already on top
 * of it with no room to level off or line up, so a point closer than the
 * module's run-in distance is pushed back along its own bearing until there
 * is. The player still chooses the DIRECTION the strike comes from, which is
 * what he actually cared about.
 *
 * THE AI IS NOT FLYING THIS AND IS NOT SHOOTING IT. CARELESS, BLUE, targeting
 * off, driver locked: the group follows two MOVE waypoints and nothing else,
 * and FUNC(fireAt) is the only thing that pulls a trigger. Arma's air AI given
 * a SAD waypoint orbits an objective without engaging often enough that every
 * support mod in existence has stopped asking it - Simplex included, for the
 * same reason and by the same means.
 *
 * A LOITER IS THE SAME FLIGHT WITH A DIFFERENT ENDING. Ingress is flown the
 * same way and for the same reason, but instead of two MOVEs through the
 * target the aircraft holds an orbit over it, nothing is released, and the
 * gunner's seat is handed to the drone controller who asked for it - see the
 * on-station event and XEH_postInit. A drone told to hold overhead used to fly
 * a strike and leave, which is neither of the things the word means.
 *
 * IT IS A REAL AIRCRAFT AND IT CAN BE LOST. Killed is wired to FUNC(killed),
 * which is what makes the module's airframe count mean anything and what makes
 * the air defence on the ridge worth putting there.
