/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * One airframe lost. Counts it against the module's stock and, when that runs
 * out, retires the asset.
 *
 * THIS IS THE WHOLE REASON THE DRONE IS A REAL AIRCRAFT. A scripted explosion
 * over the target cannot be shot down, so nothing the enemy does about it
 * matters. An airframe that is flown, seen, engaged and struck off a ledger
 * makes the air defence on the ridge worth putting there - and makes the
 * player spend the third strike more carefully than the first.
 *
 * A LOSS IS NOT A COOLDOWN. The cooldown is set by the run finishing either
 * way; this only moves the counter, so an asset shot down on its last airframe
 * reads EXPENDED rather than "rearming" for a rearm that will never come.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: The module logic <OBJECT>
 * 1: What killed it <OBJECT> (optional, for the log)
 *
 * Return Value: None
 *
 * Public: No
