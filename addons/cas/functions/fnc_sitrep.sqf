 * Author: Ghost
 * The one-line state of a CAS asset, for the support page's detail pane.
 *
 * IT SAYS WHAT IS LEFT, because that is the number the man on the radio is
 * actually deciding on. A cooldown runs out; airframes do not come back, and
 * an asset one loss from expended should be able to say so before it is asked
 * to fly into the same triple-A that took the last one.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Asset id, "ghostcas:<n>" <STRING>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * 0: Readable <BOOL>
 * 1: The line <STRING>
 *
 * Public: No
