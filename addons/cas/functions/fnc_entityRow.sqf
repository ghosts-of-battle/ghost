#include "script_component.hpp"
/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * One module as one support-page row, in the neutral shape the page already
 * reads - see the adapter's supportAssets for the contract.
 *
 *   [id, type, callsign, platform, status, ordnance, guns]
 *
 * THE SHAPE IS THE ADAPTER'S BECAUSE THE PAGE IS ALREADY WRITTEN. A CAS
 * provider that invented its own row would have needed a second renderer
 * beside the first, and the two would have drifted the first time a column
 * moved. The guns column is artillery's and stays empty here, exactly as
 * ALiVE's own air rows leave it.
 *
 * ORDNANCE IS THE AIRFRAME'S OWN STORES. The column that carries a battery's
 * shell types carries this airframe's - GBU-12, Scalpel, the cannon belt, by
 * name and with the rounds left on them - because a man calling a strike knows
 * what his drone is hung with and asks for THAT, not for a category. AUTO
 * leads the list and stays the default. See FUNC(stores) for the read and
 * FUNC(task) for the index that comes back.
 *
 * THE ID CARRIES THE PROVIDER'S NAME. "ghostcas:3" routes back to this addon
 * and to entity 3; the adapter's own ids are "cas:0" and cannot collide.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: The module logic <OBJECT>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * The row, [] when the logic is gone <ARRAY>
 *
 * Public: No
