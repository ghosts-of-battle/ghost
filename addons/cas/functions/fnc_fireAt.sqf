#include "script_component.hpp"
/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * Puts the drone's ordnance on the aim point.
 *
 * THE AI PILOT IS NOT ASKED, AND THAT IS THE DESIGN. Arma's air AI decides for
 * itself whether it likes a target, and a CAS run that depends on it is a CAS
 * run that sometimes orbits the objective without firing - which is the single
 * most reported failure of every AI-driven support script ever written. The
 * group flies CARELESS with targeting switched off; this function is the only
 * thing that pulls a trigger, so the strike either happens or logs why not.
 *
 * A DUMMY LASER TARGET IS WHAT THE ORDNANCE ACTUALLY FOLLOWS. Simplex reached
 * the same answer and for the same reason: guided ordnance released at a
 * position argument will still wander, but a real LaserTarget object is
 * something the missile's own seeker locks. One is created at the aim point,
 * the Fired handler pins each projectile to it, and both are cleaned up after.
 * On a moving laser spot the dummy is attached, so a designator walking the
 * strike onto a vehicle walks the bomb with it.
 *
 * IT SHOOTS WHAT THE AIRFRAME HAS. No pylon config and no ordnance list on the
 * module: the aircraft in the field is asked what it is carrying. Unasked, it
 * uses the heaviest air-to-ground thing aboard; asked for a store BY NAME on
 * the support page - the page offers the airframe's own, see FUNC(stores) - it
 * uses that one. A mission that wants a different loadout gives the module a
 * different airframe class, which is the honest way to say it.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: The aircraft <OBJECT>
 * 1: Aim point <ARRAY> - ATL
 * 2: Object to track, objNull for a fixed point <OBJECT>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * Something was fired <BOOL>
 *
 * Public: No
