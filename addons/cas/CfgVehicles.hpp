    // ONE MODULE IS ONE AIRFRAME ON THE BOARD, AND MANY MAY BE PLACED.
    // Unlike the enemy-drone module - where a second placement would arm the
    // same system twice and it says so - each of these IS an asset: its own
    // callsign, its own airframe, its own approach and its own losses. A
    // mission that wants two Reapers and a Bayraktar places three modules and
    // TAC//SUPPORT lists three assets.
    //
    // NO SIDE ATTRIBUTE, BY RULE (D59). player_side on Ghost - Core is the
    // only place allegiance is typed and this reads it. A CAS module belongs
    // to whoever the players are, because the support page is theirs.
    //
    // WHERE THE AIRCRAFT COMES FROM IS THE PLAYER'S CALL, NOT THE MODULE'S.
    // The module is placed for its ATTRIBUTES; the target grid and the ingress
    // and egress bearings are set per request on the support page. That is how
    // Simplex does it, and it is why one placement can run a strike onto any
    // grid on the map instead of only the ground it was dropped next to.
