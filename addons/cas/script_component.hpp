// The terminal-guidance poll. The aircraft re-looks for a laser or smoke on
// the way in rather than once, so a JTAC who lights the target LATE - which
// is the normal case, you do not burn a designator for a minute - is still
// picked up before release.

// HOW THE HEAVIEST THING ABOARD IS DECIDED, and the only place that order is
// written. FUNC(stores) ranks the airframe's stores with it so the page reads
// down the list in the order a run would have chosen for itself, and
// FUNC(fireAt) picks AUTO with it. Bombs first because that is what a strike
// is for; the gun last so an airframe carrying only cannon still makes a run
// rather than flying over silently. Submunitions sit with the bombs - a
// cluster store is a bomb to everyone except the config.
