/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * Checks every tier 2 round against the base game round it descends from, and
 * reports any that came out weaker.
 *
 * THIS IS THE ONE CHECK THAT CANNOT BE DONE IN A TEXT EDITOR. The rule is that
 * a tier 2 round must never be worse than base game ammunition - but the base
 * game's CfgAmmo lives in the engine's own config, not in any file this repo
 * has. A running mission has both loaded side by side, so this is where the
 * comparison belongs.
 *
 * THE ANCESTOR IS THE FIRST NON-FA CLASS UP THE CHAIN. A tier 2 round inherits
 * from an FA round, which inherits from a vanilla one - possibly through
 * several FA classes. Walking to the first class whose name does not begin
 * FA_ finds the base game round the whole family is built on.
 *
 * A ROUND WITH NO VANILLA ANCESTOR IS NOT A FAILURE. Some FA rounds descend
 * from other mods' ammunition, and "not worse than base game" has no meaning
 * there - those are counted and named, not flagged.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * None
 *
 * Return Value:
 * The report <STRING>
 *
 * Example:
 * [] call ghost_fa_tiers_fnc_checkFloor
 *
 * Public: No
