// RECORD SHAPES. Every record is a HashMap with the keys listed here, and every
// one of them lives on the server only. HashMaps are used rather than positional
// arrays because a message has thirteen fields and nobody can read
// `_msg select 11` correctly at two in the morning. They are converted to arrays
// by toArray at the network boundary and rebuilt with createHashMapFromArray on
// the far side, because a HashMap is not guaranteed to survive remoteExec.

// A TEMPLATE is also a HashMap, but it is built from templates.inc.sqf in
// preInit on every machine and never crosses the wire at all.

// Zero padding on generated ids, so M0042 sorts next to M0041 in a log.

// that has been connected for six hours must not be handed a six-hour index.
