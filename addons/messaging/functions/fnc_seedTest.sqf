/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * Posts a handful of plausible messages so the reader has traffic to be tested
 * against. Off by default, and only ever run on request.
 *
 * A messaging system is the one thing that cannot be tested by looking at it: an
 * empty inbox looks the same whether the engine works, the client never asked,
 * or the server dropped it. Three threads at three precedences, on three
 * different mailboxes, exercise the index, the net tabs, the FLASH treatment,
 * the reply spine and the unread counts in one go.
 *
 * They go through FUNC(submit) like anything else - the same validation, the
 * same server round trip - so what appears in the reader has been through the
 * whole path rather than injected past it.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * None
 *
 * Return Value:
 * None
 *
 * Example:
 * [] call ghost_messaging_fnc_seedTest
 *
 * Public: Yes
