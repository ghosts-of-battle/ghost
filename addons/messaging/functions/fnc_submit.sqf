#include "script_component.hpp"
/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * Sends a message. This is the only entry point a caller needs: it validates
 * locally so the player is told what is wrong before anything leaves the
 * machine, then hands it to the server, which validates again and decides.
 *
 * Addressees are mailbox ids. Three forms are understood and anything else is
 * treated as a shared mailbox name:
 *   P:<uid>       one player
 *   G:<groupId>   every player in that group, e.g. G:Alpha 1-2
 *   B:<name>      a shared mailbox, e.g. B:HQ
 *
 * TAGS ARE NOT ADDRESSEES. An addressee decides which net the thread is filed
 * on; a tag decides whose tablet goes off about it. A message to HQ tagged NOMAD
 * is filed on HQ and stays there - Nomad are woken up and allowed to answer into
 * it. See FUNC(srvTagged).
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Template id <STRING>
 * 1: Payload <ARRAY> - [fieldKey, value] pairs
 * 2: Addressees <ARRAY> (optional, default [])
 * 3: Thread to reply in, "" to open a new one <STRING> (optional, default "")
 * 4: Message being replied to, "" for the thread root <STRING> (optional, default "")
 * 5: Audience tags <ARRAY> of <STRING> (optional, default [])
 *
 * Return Value:
 * 0: Sent <BOOL>
 * 1: Why not, "" when sent <STRING>
 *
 * Example:
 * ["tic", [["Location.A", getPosATL player], ["Enemy.A", "Two technicals"]], ["B:HQ"], "", "", ["NOMAD"]] call ghost_messaging_fnc_submit
 *
 * Public: Yes
