#include "script_component.hpp"
/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * Reads the mission's report deck out of config and registers every template.
 *
 * THE DECK IS MISSION DATA NOW. It was templates.inc.sqf - 590 lines of nested
 * SQF arrays #included into this addon's preInit - so adding a line to a card,
 * or a card to the deck, meant editing and rebuilding the mod. It is
 * config\config_messaging.hpp in the mission instead, read through
 * missionConfigFile: no file paths, no preprocessing, and it works the same on
 * a dedicated server and inside a packed mission PBO.
 *
 * ORDER IS READ FROM lineOrder[], NOT FROM THE CLASS ORDER. Config class order
 * survives rapify, but nothing in the language promises it and a line deck read
 * in the wrong order is a card nobody can fill in. Each template names its lines
 * explicitly, so the order is stated rather than inferred.
 *
 * IT IS lineOrder[], NOT lines[], AND THAT IS NOT A STYLE CHOICE. Config names
 * are CASE-INSENSITIVE: an array called lines[] and a class called Lines are one
 * identifier. The parser reports "Member already defined", the array wins, and
 * every line lookup then fails with "'lines/' is not a class" - which is exactly
 * what happened, for all 94 lines of the deck, in one build.
 *
 * The field-key contract is unchanged and still lives in FUNC(registerTemplate):
 * a line's `name` is what field keys are built from, so "Line 1" gives Line1.A
 * and a SALUTE's "S" gives S.A. Renaming a line renames a field.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * None
 *
 * Return Value:
 * How many templates were registered <NUMBER>
 *
 * Example:
 * call ghost_messaging_fnc_loadTemplates
 *
 * Public: No
