 * Does an audience tag name this man?
 *
 * ONE RULE, BOTH ENDS. The server asks it of every player to find out who a tag
 * reaches (see FUNC(srvTagged)); a client asks it of itself to find out whether
 * the message that just arrived was addressed to it by name (see
 * FUNC(cltReceive)). If those two answers could ever differ, a player would be
 * pushed a message the alert stayed silent about - so there is one function and
 * they cannot.
 *
 * WHAT A TAG MAY BE, in the order it is tried:
 *   a job       MED reaches every medic, LDR every section commander - the same
 *               short tags FUNC(roleTag) stamps on traffic, so the tag you can
 *               see on a message is the tag you can address
 *   a squad     NOMAD 2-3 reaches everybody in that group
 *   a platoon   NOMAD reaches every squad the mission files under it - see
 *               FUNC(platoonTags). Without this a platoon was unaddressable:
 *               the groups are NOMAD 2-1 to 2-4 and nothing is called NOMAD, so
 *               waking a platoon on the platoon's own net took four tags
 *   a man       his call sign as the roster shows it, or his UID
 *
 * CASE AND SPACES ARE NOISE. A tag is typed in a hurry on a net; "nomad",
 * "NOMAD" and " Nomad " are the same tag, and a group called "Alpha 1-2" is
 * reachable as ALPHA1-2 as well, because nobody types the space the same way
 * twice.
 *
 * NOT ALERT LEVELS. FLASH and ROUTINE are the template's business - see
 * FUNC(registerTemplate) - and a sender who could type his own urgency would
 * type FLASH on everything by the third mission.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Unit <OBJECT>
 * 1: Tag <STRING>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * The tag names him <BOOL>
 *
 * Example:
 * private _hit = [player, "NOMAD"] call ghost_messaging_fnc_tagMatch
 *
 * Public: Yes

// THE BACKEND DEFINES the composer's job chips lean on (user, 2026-09-03:
// "leaders medics, demo, isr, pilots, jfo"). Six trades, and a tag has to
// reach every man doing one of them wherever he stands - a CASEVAC calling
// MEDICS does not know whose medic.
//
// THREE SOURCES, ASKED IN THIS ORDER, because no single one is reliable across
// missions:
//
//   1. THE MISSION'S OWN FLAG, where it keeps one. isLeader, isJFO and isISR
//      are customVariables the role configs already set, and they are the same
//      flags the role screen and TAC//SUPPORT gate on.
//   2. AN ENGINE TRAIT, where the game carries one. medic and
//      explosiveSpecialist are set by every mission one way or another, so
//      these work on a mission that has never heard of ghost.
//   3. THE ROLE CLASS NAME. FUNC(setupPlayer) writes the chosen class to
//      YMF_role publicly, so pilotTalon answers PILOTS and demoBanshee answers
//      DEMO with no flag at all. This is what PILOTS runs on: nothing in the
//      framework sets isPilot, and roleDescription is not used here, so the
//      old check reached nobody.
//
// OLD NAMES STILL ANSWER. HQ was the leader tag and AVIATION the pilot one;
// traffic sent before the chips were renamed still resolves.
