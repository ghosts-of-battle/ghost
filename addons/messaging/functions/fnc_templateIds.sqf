 * Author: Ghost
 * Lists template ids in registration order, optionally filtered by what they
 * can be used for. Registration order is kept because the templates file is
 * ordered the way the Ghost smart-card deck is, and a UI that sorted them
 * alphabetically would put AIRDROP above CASEVAC.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Kind - "root", "reply" or "" for all <STRING> (optional, default "")
 * 1: Thread status a reply must be legal in, "" to ignore <STRING> (optional, default "")
 *
 * Return Value:
 * Template ids <ARRAY>
 *
 * Example:
 * private _replies = ["reply", "ISSUED"] call ghost_messaging_fnc_templateIds
 *
 * Public: Yes

// openCompose died on `forEach false` the first time anyone pressed NEW.
