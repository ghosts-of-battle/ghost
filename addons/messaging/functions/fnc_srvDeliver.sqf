#include "script_component.hpp"
/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * Files a thread into the mailboxes it was addressed to and pushes the new
 * message to everyone who should see it now.
 *
 * Addressees are only read on the message that opened the thread plus any the
 * sender adds later; a reply inherits the thread's mailboxes, so answering a
 * report cannot quietly narrow who can still read it.
 *
 * THE THREAD LIVES IN ONE BOX AND EVERY ROW SAYS SO. This is the fix for "I
 * send a message to HQ and I cannot see it in HQ", and the previous attempt at
 * it - reordering the wanted list so the personal box came last - did nothing,
 * because it was aimed at the wrong half of the problem.
 *
 * What actually happened: a shared mailbox has no members (see
 * FUNC(srvMembers) - a filing box delivers to nobody, by design), so the only
 * box that ever REACHED the sender was their own personal one, whatever order
 * the list was in. The row they got was therefore stamped P:<uid>, the reader
 * filters the net tabs on B:<net>, and the sender's own traffic was visible on
 * ALL and on no net at all. Everybody else got theirs stamped B:HQ from the
 * shared fallback at the bottom, which is why it looked like the sender
 * specifically was cursed.
 *
 * So the box on the row is no longer "whichever mailbox happened to reach you
 * first". It is the thread's own box - the net it was posted to - for every
 * recipient alike. The personal box still exists and still catches a sender no
 * addressed box reached; it just no longer decides how anything is filed.
 *
 * The ROUTING tick that DEFREP carries is resolved here rather than in the
 * template, because "the command group" is a mission setting and a template is
 * content.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Sending player <OBJECT>
 * 1: Thread <HASHMAP>
 * 2: Message <HASHMAP>
 * 3: Addressees <ARRAY> - mailbox ids or bare names
 *
 * Return Value:
 * None
 *
 * Public: No

// when the traffic is routine and the net is one he never reads. See
