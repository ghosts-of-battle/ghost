 * Author: Ghost
 * A message arrived for this player. Updates the index row, appends to the
 * thread cache if the thread is open, and tells the player once.
 *
 * The notification is the whole point of the seam: a warning from messaging has
 * to look like a warning from anything else in the mod, so it goes through
 * FUNC(notify) and never touches the widget directly.
 *
 * An empty message is the quiet form: something was filed to a shared mailbox
 * this player can read but was not addressed to them. The row is updated and
 * nothing is said, because a filing cabinet does not ring.
 *
 * Arguments (CBA event):
 * 0: Message <ARRAY> - array form of a message HashMap, [] for a row-only update
 * 1: Index entry <ARRAY> - array form of an index HashMap
 *
 * Return Value:
 * None
 *
 * Public: No
