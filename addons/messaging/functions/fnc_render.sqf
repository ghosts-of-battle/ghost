#include "script_component.hpp"
/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * Renders a message as plain text, line by line, the way it would be read out
 * over the net. There is no UI yet, so this is how a message is seen at all -
 * in a notification, in a systemChat line, in the debug console. When a UI does
 * arrive it renders from the same payload, not from this string.
 *
 * Empty fields are skipped. A form with eleven lines of which two are filled is
 * a two line report, not nine blank rows.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Template id <STRING>
 * 1: Payload <ARRAY> - [fieldKey, value] pairs
 * 2: Include the template's own title as a first line <BOOL> (optional, default true)
 *
 * Return Value:
 * Rendered report <STRING>
 *
 * Example:
 * private _text = ["sitrep", _payload] call ghost_messaging_fnc_render
 *
 * Public: Yes
