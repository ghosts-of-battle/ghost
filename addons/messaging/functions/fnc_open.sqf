/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * Opens a thread: fetches its messages from the server if they are not cached,
 * marks them read, and hands the rendered thread to the callback. With no UI
 * yet the default callback prints it, which is how a thread is read today.
 *
 * The bodies are fetched per thread rather than pushed with the index, because
 * an index is small and a mission's worth of report bodies is not.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Thread id <STRING>
 * 1: Called with [thread, messages] once they arrive <CODE> (optional, default prints)
 *
 * Return Value:
 * None
 *
 * Example:
 * ["T0007"] call ghost_messaging_fnc_open
 *
 * Public: Yes
