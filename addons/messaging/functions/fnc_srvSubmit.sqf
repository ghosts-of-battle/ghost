/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * Accepts or refuses a submitted message. This is the only function that writes
 * a message into the store, so every rule about who may say what runs here or
 * in srvThreadFor, and nowhere else. The client validated first as a courtesy
 * to the player; this is the validation that decides.
 *
 * The sender is taken from the unit that was handed in, after checking it is a
 * live player. The spec asks for the sending machine to be read off the engine
 * instead, which needs a raw remoteExec - and the rest of the mod deliberately
 * travels on CBA's event channel, which a mission's CfgRemoteExec cannot close.
 * Impersonating another player from here already requires a client running
 * arbitrary code, so the stricter check buys nothing it does not already cost.
 *
 * Arguments (CBA event):
 * 0: Sending player <OBJECT>
 * 1: Draft nonce, one per press of send <STRING>
 * 2: Template id <STRING>
 * 3: Payload <ARRAY> - [fieldKey, value] pairs
 * 4: Addressees <ARRAY> - mailbox ids or bare names
 * 5: Thread to reply in, "" to open a new one <STRING>
 * 6: Message being replied to, "" for the thread root <STRING>
 * 7: File it under another call sign, "" to use the sender's <STRING>
 * 8: Audience tags <ARRAY> of <STRING>
 *
 * THE CALL SIGN OVERRIDE IS FOR TESTING ALONE, and it is here rather than in a
 * second write path because a test that files messages through code the live
 * system does not use proves nothing about the live system. A message filed
 * under another call sign is also NOT pre-read by the sender, so it arrives
 * unread with a notification - which is the half of the system a man testing on
 * his own can otherwise never see. See the msg.* admin commands.
 *
 * Return Value:
 * None
 *
 * Public: No
