/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * The ONE tag to put on a man's notification, out of every tag that named him.
 *
 * A MAN IS CALLED OUT ONCE (user, 2026-09-03: "do not double notify"). The
 * notification used to carry every matching tag joined together, so a team lead
 * on a CASEVAC tagged LEADERS, ISR and JFO read
 * "LEADERS ISR JFO CASEVAC Ghost 6" - one banner that looks like three, and the
 * three words that mattered least pushed the callsign off the end of it.
 *
 * It got worse the day the job tags were widened. A lead carries isLeader,
 * isISR and isJFO because he tasks drones and fires, so three of the six job
 * chips name him and any two of them stack.
 *
 * THE MOST SPECIFIC ONE WINS, because that is the one that tells him something
 * he did not already know:
 *
 *   0  him          his call sign or his UID - somebody wanted HIM
 *   1  his squad    the group he is standing in
 *   2  his platoon  a platoon that lists his squad
 *   3  a job        MEDICS, LEADERS - true of him and of a dozen others
 *
 * TIES KEEP THE SENDER'S ORDER. Two jobs are equally specific, so the first one
 * typed wins; a sender who leads with MEDICS meant MEDICS.
 *
 * NOT A PERMISSION CHECK, and not a filter. Every tag still reaches everyone it
 * names and every one of them is still on the message - see FUNC(tagMatch) and
 * FUNC(srvTagged). This only decides which word goes on the banner.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: The man <OBJECT>
 * 1: The tags that already matched him <ARRAY> of <STRING>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * One tag, upper-cased, or "" when the list is empty <STRING>
 *
 * Example:
 * private _shout = [player, ["ISR", "GHOST 6"]] call ghost_messaging_fnc_tagCallout
 *
 * Public: Yes
