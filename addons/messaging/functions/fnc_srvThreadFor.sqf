#include "script_component.hpp"
/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * Works out which thread a submission belongs to and whether the sender is
 * allowed to put it there - opening a new thread when there is no thread id,
 * checking the reply rules when there is.
 *
 * This is its own function rather than a branch inside srvSubmit because every
 * check here wants to stop the rest of them, and exitWith inside an if/then
 * block exits the block, not the function. Split out, each refusal is a plain
 * early return and cannot silently fall through to the next check.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Sending player <OBJECT>
 * 1: Template <HASHMAP>
 * 2: Payload <ARRAY>
 * 3: Thread id, "" to open a new one <STRING>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * 0: Thread <HASHMAP>, empty when refused
 * 1: Why not, "" when accepted <STRING>
 * 2: This opened the thread <BOOL>
 *
 * Example:
 * ([_unit, _template, _payload, ""] call ghost_messaging_fnc_srvThreadFor) params ["_thread", "_why", "_isRoot"]
 *
 * Public: No
