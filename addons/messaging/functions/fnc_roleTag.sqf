/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * A man's job, as the three or four letters a net calls him by.
 *
 * OFF ENGINE TRAITS, NOT OFF A MOD. Medic, engineer, EOD and UAV are traits the
 * game itself carries and every mission sets one way or another, so this works
 * on a mission that has never heard of ghost. Leadership is asked last because a
 * section commander who is also the medic is the medic to anybody calling for
 * one.
 *
 * IT IS STAMPED AT SEND TIME, not read back later - see FUNC(srvSubmit). A man
 * who was the medic when he sent a CASEVAC is still the man who sent it after he
 * has been promoted, and a tag that changes retrospectively is a tag that lies
 * about the traffic.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Unit <OBJECT>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * Short role tag, "" when nothing distinguishes him <STRING>
 *
 * Example:
 * private _tag = [player] call ghost_messaging_fnc_roleTag
 *
 * Public: Yes
