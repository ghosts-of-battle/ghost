 * Who a mailbox delivers to right now. Membership is derived every time rather
 * than stored, because a player changes group mid-mission and a stored member
 * list would still be mailing their old squad an hour later.
 *
 * A shared mailbox delivers to nobody. That is not an oversight - it is what a
 * filing box is. The report is filed and shows up in the index of everyone who
 * can see that box; it does not ring a phone.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Box id <STRING>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * Players to deliver to <ARRAY>
 *
 * Example:
 * private _who = ["G:Alpha 1-2"] call ghost_messaging_fnc_srvMembers
 *
 * Public: No
