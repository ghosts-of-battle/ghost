/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * TROOPS IN CONTACT. Carried over from the cTab template of the same name.
 *
 * A TIC was never really a message - it was an alarm somebody typed into a
 * message form, and it is the one report that reaches people it was not
 * addressed to. In cTab that behaviour was hardcoded against the template's
 * uid; here it is a template flag, so a mission can put it on another report
 * without editing any code.
 *
 * It goes out on the shared alert bus rather than straight to the notification
 * widget, so it lands in the same list as every other thing that went bang and
 * anything else listening to that bus hears it too.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Sending player <OBJECT>
 * 1: Thread <HASHMAP>
 * 2: Payload <ARRAY>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * None
 *
 * Public: No
