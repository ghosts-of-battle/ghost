/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * Everything filed in one net, as ONE conversation in time order.
 *
 * A NET IS A CONVERSATION, NOT A FOLDER. It was a filter: picking HQ narrowed a
 * list of separate threads and you clicked one to read it, so a message sent to
 * HQ was two clicks from being visible in HQ. A radio net does not work like
 * that - everything said on it is said in order, and a report is a thing said on
 * it rather than a folder hung off it.
 *
 * THE REPORT'S STATE TRAVELS WITH THE MESSAGE. Each entry carries the thread it
 * came from, so a CASEVAC line can still show OPEN or CLAIMED without the reader
 * having to go and look it up - and without the player having to leave the net
 * to see it.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT CACHED IS ASKED FOR, ONCE. The index holds summaries, not bodies;
 * the bodies arrive per thread. Anything missing is requested here and the count
 * is handed back, so the reader can say it is still fetching rather than drawing
 * a conversation with holes in it.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Box id, e.g. "B:HQ". "" for every box this player can see <STRING>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * 0: [[message <HASHMAP>, thread <HASHMAP>], ...] oldest first <ARRAY>
 * 1: Threads still being fetched <NUMBER>
 *
 * Example:
 * (["B:HQ"] call ghost_messaging_fnc_netStream) params ["_stream", "_pending"]
 *
 * Public: Yes
