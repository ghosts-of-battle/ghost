    Description: The unit's ORBAT - the squads and their slots, the platoon
        tabs and the faction's name - from ONE place.
        TAC//PAC keeps it in the unit's database (or the profile) as the
        structure's "orbat" section when that is loaded and has one;
        otherwise it is the mission's Dynamic_Groups, read the way it always
        was. Every reader of group_setup / Platoons /
        faction_name in the mod asks this instead, so a unit that edits its
        ORBAT in the database sees the edit in the group menu, the radio
        plan, the platoon tags and the nets alike.

        Shapes, the mission's own:
            groups     [[name, [roleClass, ...], conditionString], ...]  - order
                       is the SR radio block order, so it is never re-sorted
            platoons   [[id, name, callsign, net, [squadName, ...]], ...]
            faction    the name over the role screen
            side       "WEST" | "EAST" | "GUER" | "CIV" - which side of the war
                       the unit's groups are created on. Added 2026-09-09; a
                       unit that never says answers "WEST", which is what every
                       caller assumed before it existed.

    Parameters:
        None

    Returns:
        ARRAY - [groups, platoons, faction, side]
