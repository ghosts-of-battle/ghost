    Description:
        Paints and sizes the role selection screen from the player's ghost
        tacpad settings.

        WHY A FUNCTION AND NOT CONFIG. The colours in dialogs\groupMenu.hpp are
        the dark scheme, written once so the display never flashes a wrong
        colour on the way up. Everything a player can actually change - which of
        the seven schemes, how solid the ground is, how big the whole thing
        should be - lives in ghost's CBA settings, and a config file cannot read
        those. So the display opens, and the first thing it does is repaint
        itself in whatever the player picked.

        THE SCALE IS APPLIED ABOUT THE CENTRE OF THE SCREEN. Shrunk from the
        top-left corner the screen drifts toward it; shrunk about the middle it
        stays the same screen, smaller, with a margin round it.

        GHOST MAY NOT BE LOADED. It is a mission, not an addon - so every read
        has a default and the screen still looks like itself on a bare install.

    Parameters:
        0: DISPLAY - the role menu, as its onLoad hands it over

    Returns:
        NOTHING
