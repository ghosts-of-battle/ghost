    Description:
        Switches the role screen to one platoon tab: repaints the row so the
        pressed tab is the lit one, and refills the tree behind it.

        THE SELECTED TAB'S LABEL IS THE ACCENT (user, 2026-09-01), the rest are
        the same words at a muted ink. Every tab keeps the lift the rail is drawn
        on, so the row reads as one strip of chips with a single lit name in it -
        the accent as ink rather than as a block of fill, which is quieter beside
        the tree below and still the only thing on that row worth reading.

        THIS FUNCTION WRITES THE TEXT, NOT JUST THE COLOUR. A tab is structured
        text now (two lines - see script_component.hpp) and structured text
        carries its colour inside its own markup, so there is nothing for a
        ctrlSetTextColor to change. fn_initGroupMenu therefore sets no labels of
        its own and ends by calling this, which is the only place the row is
        drawn - one function, so a tab painted by a click is painted exactly the
        way the opening draw painted it.

    Parameters:
        0: NUMBER - which tab, zero-based

    Returns:
        NOTHING
