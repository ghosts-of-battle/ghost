    Author: YMF (restyled to the ghost suite)

    Description:
        Opens the role selection screen, builds the platoon tab row and fills
        the tree behind it.

        THE TREE ROWS FOLLOW THE THEME. They were hard-coded [1,1,1,alpha] -
        white, on whatever ground the scheme happened to be - so on a light
        scheme the whole list vanished. The colour comes from
        YMF_groupMenu_theme, which ghost_groups_fnc_styleGroupMenu leaves behind when the
        display opens.

        THE TABS ARE A VIEW, NOT A RULE (user, 2026-09-01). They decide which
        squads the tree draws and nothing else: the roles, the order, the
        conditions, who may take what and the OPEN count at the top right all
        still come off the whole of Dynamic_Groups. See FUNC(platoons) for the
        config and FUNC(fillRoleTree) for the draw.

        THIS FUNCTION DOES NOT DRAW A TAB. It shows the controls the mission
        earned, hides the rest, puts the tree under them and hands off to
        FUNC(selectPlatoon), which writes every label on the row. A tab is
        structured text carrying its own colours, so there is no half-drawn
        state worth writing here and then correcting there.

        THE ROW WRAPS AND THE TREE MOVES WITH IT. Four tabs to a row (gui.hpp);
        a fifth platoon opens a second row and the tree drops by exactly one row
        to make space for it. The drop is measured off the two rows' real
        positions rather than written as a number, so the player's UI scale -
        already applied to every control by the style pass in the display's
        onLoad - is carried with it.

        A MISSION WITH NO Platoons CLASS IS UNCHANGED. Every tab control is
        hidden and the tree is put back to the full height it had before there
        was a row above it, so the screen is the one that shipped.

    Parameters:
        NONE

    Returns:
        NOTHING
