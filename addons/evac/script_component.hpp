// Medic-gated evac that replaces engine respawn. A downed (ACE-unconscious)
// player is "evacuated" by a medic:
//   1. the ACTUAL player is fully healed in place (ace_medical_treatment_fnc_fullHeal)
//      and placed on the medic - same object, so their loadout is untouched;
//   2. a separate AI clone is spawned at the downed spot with the same loadout AND
//      the player's exact injuries copied across (the full ACE medical var surface
//      + hitpoint damage), then knocked unconscious.
// The AI is alive and fully mortal - it keeps the wounds it was cloned with, so it
// can still bleed out or go into cardiac arrest and die - but it NEVER wakes: any
// wake-up (treated to stable vitals, epi, etc.) is caught on the ace_unconscious
// event and immediately re-knocked-out. Set the mission to no respawn so the medic
// evac is the only way back. Pure ACE medical - no ACM dependency.

#define EVAC_DEFAULT_TIME 10   // seconds: medic evac progress-bar time
