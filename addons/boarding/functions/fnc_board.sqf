#include "script_component.hpp"
/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * Loads every player near a boarding point into cargo. SERVER SIDE.
 *
 * The presser is not the owner of the other players, and moveInCargo wants
 * the unit local - so each seating is sent to the machine that owns that
 * player rather than run here and hoped for.
 *
 * Nobody is teleported across the map: the range is the mission's, and a
 * player outside it is simply not this button's business. People already in a
 * vehicle are left where they are, because pulling a gunner out of his turret
 * to sit in the back of a truck is never what was meant.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: The module <OBJECT>
 * 1: The player who pressed <OBJECT>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * None
 *
 * Example:
 * [_logic, _player] call ghost_boarding_fnc_board
