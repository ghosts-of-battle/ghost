 * Synchronised vehicles are the mission's answer and are used as given.

 * module dropped beside the trucks that are already parked there should just
 * work.
 *
 * Nearest first so a section fills the vehicle it is standing at before the
 * one across the compound.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: The module <OBJECT>

 * Return Value:
 * Vehicles with at least one free cargo seat <ARRAY>

 * Example:
 * [_logic] call ghost_boarding_fnc_seatsFor
