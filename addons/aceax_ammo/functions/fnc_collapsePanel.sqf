/*
 * Collapse the ammo panel so each family occupies one row.
 *
 * Runs a frame after ace_arsenal_rightPanelFilled, once ACE has finished
 * sorting the list and restoring the selection - the timing @aceaxatt uses for
 * the attachment slots, and for the same reason. At that point the panel holds
 * exactly the magazines valid here: ACE has already filtered by
 * compatibleMagazines and by what the arsenal offers, so this needs to know
 * nothing about the weapon.
 *
 * THE ROWS ARE THE TRUTH. What survives is decided from a snapshot of the
 * panel, and what the dropdown may offer afterwards is exactly the members
 * that were IN the panel (GVAR(present)) - never the family's whole roster
 * from config, which would let a player pick a tracer variant the arsenal
 * does not carry or this muzzle does not take.
 *
 * WHICH ROW SURVIVES: the highlighted one if it is in the family, so the
 * collapse never moves the player's selection off what they had; else the
 * variant the player last picked for that family (GVAR(choice)), so moving to
 * another weapon and back keeps it; else the family's first row, which leaves
 * the panel in ACE's own sort order.
 *
 * Collapsing the LIST and not ace_arsenal_virtualItems is deliberate, for the
 * same reason the attachment compat does it: magazine compatibility is per
 * weapon, so a representative chosen once and globally could be one the
 * selected weapon does not take, and the whole family would disappear.
 * Nothing of ACE's is written.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Arsenal display <DISPLAY>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * None
