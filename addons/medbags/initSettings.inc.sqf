// CBA Settings [ADDON: ghost_medbags]

// WHAT IS IN EACH BAG, AS SETTINGS. Every bag's contents used to be a column of
// hardcoded EFUNC(common,addItem) calls in its own fnc_doUnpack* - so changing
// what a Trauma Kit holds meant editing SQF and rebuilding the mod, for a
// number. The five lists below are the same items in the same order; the
// functions now read them.
//
// FORMAT: class:count, comma separated. Whitespace around either is ignored.
//
// ORDER IS SIGNIFICANT and DUPLICATES ARE KEPT. The list is issued top to
// bottom into a man who runs out of room partway down, so what is early in the
// list is what he ends up carrying. That is also why MedicKit and Trauma name
// ACE_fieldDressing and ACE_tourniquet more than once: those repeats are in the
// original lists, they land in different containers as earlier ones fill, and
// collapsing them into one bigger number is not the same issue.
//
// A CLASS NOTHING DEFINES IS SKIPPED, with a line in the RPT - see
// fnc_issueContents. It is not silently dropped and it does not litter the
// ground with an empty holder.
