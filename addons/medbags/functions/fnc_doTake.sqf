/*
 * Author: YonV
 * Moves every medical bag the casualty is carrying onto the player.
 *
 * ALL OF THEM, IN ONE PULL. A man working on a casualty under fire should not
 * be reopening an interaction menu five times, and a casualty is not going to
 * use the kit himself while he is out. One activation clears whatever he has.
 *
 * REMOVED FIRST, THEN GIVEN. FUNC(addItem) falls back to the ground when the
 * player has no room for a bag, so a bag can never be destroyed by taking it -
 * worst case it lands at the player's feet. The removal still happens first, so
 * a full player cannot duplicate the bag by taking it twice.
 *
 * THE CASUALTY IS NOT NECESSARILY LOCAL. removeItem on a remote unit does
 * nothing at all, so the strip runs where the casualty is and the handover
 * comes back to the player - who is, by definition, local to himself.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Player <OBJECT>
 * 1: Casualty <OBJECT>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * The bags taken <ARRAY of STRING>
 *
 * Example:
 * [player, cursorObject] call ghost_medbags_fnc_doTake;
 *
 * Public: No
