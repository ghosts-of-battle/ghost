#include "..\script_component.hpp"
/*
 * Author: YonV
 * Issues one bag's worth of kit to a unit, from a "class:count" settings list.
 *
 * WHAT THIS REPLACED. Every fnc_doUnpack* ended in a column of hardcoded
 * EFUNC(common,addItem) calls - thirteen of them in the Medic Bag - each with
 * its own copy of a private _order and a private _overflow that were the same
 * numbers every time. Changing what a bag holds meant editing SQF and shipping
 * a new PBO. The lists are settings now (see initSettings.inc.sqf) and this is
 * the one place that reads them.
 *
 * ORDER IS KEPT, DUPLICATES INCLUDED. The list is issued top to bottom, and a
 * man fills up: what is early in the list is what he keeps. A class named twice
 * is issued twice, because the second helping lands in a different container
 * once the first has filled the near one.
 *
 * A CLASS NOTHING DEFINES IS SKIPPED. EFUNC(common,addItem) does not check that
 * an item exists - canAddItemToUniform is false for a classname that was never
 * defined, so the item falls through to the overflow branch, which builds a
 * GroundWeaponHolder, puts nothing in it and leaves it standing there. That is
 * how "GHOST_Apap" behaved in here: a painkiller ghost defines and DIVINER does
 * not, issued by three bags, arriving as nothing. It is out of the defaults, and
 * anything else that goes the same way now says so in the RPT instead.
 *
 * SCHEDULED ONLY. It sleeps between items, as the unpack always did. Call it
 * from the spawn in a fnc_doUnpack*, not from unscheduled code.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Unit <OBJECT>
 * 1: Contents, "class:count" comma separated <STRING>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * How many entries were issued <NUMBER>
 *
 * Example:
 * [_unit, GVAR(contentsFirstAid)] call ghost_medbags_fnc_issueContents;
 *
 * Public: No
