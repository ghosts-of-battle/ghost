// Vanilla vehicle missile weapons don't use CBA magazine wells — the magazine
// list lives directly on the CfgWeapons turret weapon class, so every append
// below is `+=`, never `=` (same shared-class rule as the mediumcaliber
// autocannon patches). Pylon* magazines are NOT appended here: the dynamic
// loadout system pairs them with their pylonWeapon via hardpoints[].
// Each weapon is reopened WITH its real parent named (parents forward-declared).
// A parentless reopen (`class missiles_titan { ... };`) makes HEMTT emit the
// class with no base; with undefined load order against other mods that also
// touch these launchers, the parentless one can win the bind and strip the
// vanilla parent link, collapsing the weapon to an empty stub — which is why the
// appended missiles can silently fail to appear. Vanilla parents: missiles_titan:
// MissileLauncher, missiles_titan_AA:missiles_titan, missiles_SCALPEL/DAGR/
// rockets_Skyfire:RocketPods, Missile_AGM_02_Plane_CAS_01_F:MissileLauncher.

    // their CfgWeapons definition isn't in the available a3 dump, so naming a
    // parent risks reparenting them to the wrong base (which strips the launcher
    // and drops all its rounds). A bodied, parentless reopen MERGES into the
    // existing launcher instead - it keeps the real parent/optic and just adds
    // our magazines (the mediumcaliber autocannon_30mm pattern). Faction/camo
    // variants inherit these two bases and don't override magazines[], so the
    // rounds flow to them. AT -> full MPRL, AA -> the short (AA) MPRL.

    // magazineWells Titan_Short (AT launcher + the rest) and Titan_Long (AA launcher)
