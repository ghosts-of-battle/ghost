#include "script_component.hpp"
/*
 * Author: CPL.Brostrom.A -- Tinkered with by YonV
 * THE COSMETIC CATALOGUE. One list, two readers: the ACE self-interaction menu
 * (FUNC(addCosmeticSelection)) and the MOTORPOOL spawner screen
 * (FUNC(motorpool_select)) both consume this, so a paint scheme added once
 * appears in both.
 *
 * THE CATALOGUE IS CONFIG NOW, AND IT LIVES IN THE MISSION. This used to be a
 * hand-built array in scripts\vehicle\fn_vehicle_cosmeticEntries.sqf - eighty
 * entries of SQF, three of the families built by forEach loops. It is
 * missionConfigFile >> "Ghost_Cosmetics" instead, so adding a scheme is an edit
 * to config\config_cosmetics.hpp and nothing else: no mod rebuild, no code.
 *
 * THE RETURN SHAPE IS UNCHANGED - ["baseClass", "Display Name", ["icon", code]]
 * - so neither reader had to be touched. The code blocks read `_vehicle` as a
 * free variable from the caller's scope, exactly as they did before; bind
 * `private _vehicle = ...` before calling one.
 *
 * A label starting with "Toggle" is a fitting; anything else is a paint scheme.
 *
 * COMPILED ONCE AND CACHED. Both readers run per vehicle - the ACE menu on
 * every vehicle that gets actions, the motorpool on every selection change -
 * and compiling eighty code strings each time is work nobody asked for. The
 * cache is dropped if the mission config has nothing, so a mission that loads
 * a catalogue late still picks it up.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * None
 *
 * Return Value:
 * Entries <ARRAY>
 *
 * Example:
 * private _entries = call ghost_vehicle_fnc_cosmeticEntries;
 *
 * Public: No
