// cannot sit on the platoon net and the detachment net at the same time, and a
// vehicle that can only hold one of those conversations is a vehicle somebody

// channels rather than a second item - but the racks are named for what they
// are, tuned to their own half of the LR plan, and only the satcom one gets the
