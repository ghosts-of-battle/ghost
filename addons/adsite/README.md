# Air Defence Sites

`ghost_adsite`

Coordinated air defence that shoots down munitions as well as aircraft. Built
from `docs/DESIGN_AIR_DEFENCE.md` (2026-10-07); the placement stays
`ghost_airdefence`'s and the radar emission stays `ghost_iads`' - this addon is
the brain that engages for both.

**A Site** is a set of vehicles that defend one area together: every battery
`ghost_airdefence` places for an ALiVE commander, and any group a mission maker
syncs to a **Ghost - Air Defence Site** module. Its side is its members' side.

- **Munitions as well as aircraft.** Missiles, rockets, bombs, artillery, mortar
  and MLRS rounds are found on the server the way `ghost_aps` finds them, and
  engaged only while their predicted impact is inside the protected area - a
  shell landing clear costs nothing. Aircraft are hostile by the sides' own
  relations and have to be seen.
- **Each vehicle as it really is.** Roles, reach and radar range are read from
  its own config and loadout (`fnc_profile`), and it fires its own weapons, so
  ballistics, guidance and damage are the game's.
- **Layered.** CIWS and guns are the inner layer, short-range missiles take the
  bulk of a salvo, long-range missiles are held in reserve for what only they
  can reach. A **proximity fuse** detonates the interceptor - and a munition
  target in the air - inside the interceptor ammo's own blast radius.
- **A CIWS corrects its own aim** from where its last rounds passed, and opens
  fire only when a burst has a real chance.
- **Linked Sites** share one picture and one set of commitments, so two
  batteries never fire at one target.
- **Radar emission** (automatic, silent until cued, burst search) and the
  anti-radiation shutdown run through `ghost_iads`' own levers, so the two
  never fight over a radar.
- **Crews** react by skill and a temperament drawn once and kept, and an
  unskilled crew sometimes fumbles.
- **Warnings are ghost notices** - going live, and one incoming notice per
  salvo - to the Site's side.
- **The terminal is the tacpad.** The AIR DEFENCE panel on the map screen:
  STATUS, INTERCEPT (pick a track, pick a weapon; automation on or off; STRIKE
  a point on the map) and SETTINGS; the map draws every own-side Site's area and
  tracks. Who may command is the module's Tacpad Control, checked on the server.
- **Zeus:** with Zeus Enhanced, right-click a Site's vehicle for its settings
  and that vehicle's hold-fire override.
- **Server-side:** detection, assignment and engagement all run on the server.

    #ghost adsite          Sites, members, tracks, commitments
    #ghost adsite.probe    Phase 0 - the engine questions the engagement rests on

**Not yet verified in game.** The probe answers the three engine questions the
design depends on (A0-1..3: the server sees a round in flight, a SAM fires at a
round, the SAM can be steered onto it); run it once before trusting a result.

### Ghost - Air Defence Site

`ghost_moduleADSite`, category ghost_modules

An air defence Site: sync the radars, launchers, guns and CIWS that make it. It pools what they see, gives each aircraft or incoming round to the best-fit weapon - guns inside, short-range missiles for the bulk, long-range held in reserve - fires the vehicles' own weapons, and runs on the server. Status and control are on the tacpad.
