/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * `#ghost adsite.probe`: Phase 0 of docs/DESIGN_AIR_DEFENCE.md, driven in front
 * of whoever runs it. Code built on an unverified engine guess runs, logs
 * success and does the opposite - so these are asked of the engine, not assumed:
 *
 *   A0-3  does the server see a round in flight (nearObjects), so a Site can track it?
 *   A0-2  does fireAtTarget fire a Site's SAM at an object that is not a vehicle?
 *   A0-1  does setMissileTarget turn that SAM onto the round?
 *
 * Needs a Site with a missile launcher. A mortar round is dropped from 900 m
 * over the Site's centre and the nearest launcher is ordered onto it; the
 * answers are printed as they come.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Command arguments <ARRAY>
 * 1: Who asked <OBJECT>
 *
 * Return Value: None
 *
 * Public: No
