 * Author: Ghost
 * The proximity fuse (F1), every frame, for every interceptor in flight.
 *
 * Inside the fuse distance - the interceptor ammo's own blast radius - both go:
 * the interceptor detonates, and a munition target detonates where it is, in
 * the air, short of what it was falling on. An aircraft is left to the game's
 * own damage from the interceptor's blast. This is ghost_aps' intercept, which
 * already kills rockets and missiles short of a hull, done on the way in.
 *
 * A GUN ROUND that passes its target is measured: where it went past, as a
 * vector, folded into the gun's aim correction (F7) - so the next burst leads
 * by what this one actually missed by.
 *
 * Arguments: None
