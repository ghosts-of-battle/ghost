 * A Site member's Fired event: the interceptor is caught as it leaves.
 *
 * A missile fired at a munition is steered onto it (setMissileTarget - A0-1 of
 * the design: whether the engine flies a SAM at a shell is what the probe
 * answers; if it does not, the fuse still catches the round on the predicted
 * course). Every interceptor goes to the fuse (FUNC(fuze)) with its target, so
 * it detonates by proximity, and is marked so no Site ever tracks its own shot
 * as a threat.
 *
 * Arguments: the Fired event's own
 *
 * Return Value: None

 * Public: No
