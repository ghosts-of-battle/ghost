// THE BEAT. How often a Site looks at its sky and hands out threats. A mortar
// round is in the air for twenty seconds and a rocket for fewer; a quarter of a
// second is four looks a second, which leaves the crews' own reaction time -
// not this number - as what decides whether a round is caught.

// How often the server publishes the board the tacpad panel draws. A panel that
// redraws every two seconds needs nothing fresher.

// Munitions are looked for this far beyond a Site's longest reach: a round has
// to be seen before it is inside the envelope, or the first look is too late.
#define ADS_TRACK_MARGIN 1500

// Impact predicted inside the protected area plus this margin counts as a
// threat. A shell's predicted point is ballistic and wind-free; the margin is
// what wind and drag can move it, so a round that lands just inside is not
// waved through on a rounding.

// A gun counts as a CIWS - the inner layer that bursts at what it can hit - when
// its fastest mode fires faster than this (seconds between rounds). A Praetorian
// is about 0.0133; an AA autocannon about 0.06.
