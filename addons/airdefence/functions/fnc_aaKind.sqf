/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * What kind of air defence this static is - none, gun or missile.
 *
 * Asked of the config rather than a class list, because a class list is a
 * maintenance job that goes stale the first time somebody loads a mod this was
 * not written against. A weapon that shoots at aircraft carries an air-target
 * magazine; whether its round is a missile is what separates a SAM launcher
 * from an AA gun turret, and a BATTERY is launchers - the sweep that treated
 * the two alike is how a "battery" came out as a ring of gun turrets.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Vehicle class <STRING>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * 0 does not engage aircraft / 1 gun / 2 missile <NUMBER>
 *
 * Example:
 * ["O_SAM_System_04_F"] call ghost_airdefence_fnc_aaKind
