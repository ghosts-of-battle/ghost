 * Decides what every commander gets and where, then builds it.
 *
 * WHERE IS NEVER ASKED FOR. Each commander's own TAOR and its own objectives
 * are read from ALiVE; a mission maker tunes how many and how open the ground
 * has to be, never which ground.
 *
 * WHAT depends on how the commander fights, also read from ALiVE:
 *   invasion / occupation - a radar cueing launchers set back from it
 *   asymmetric            - men with MANPADS, spread over its objectives
 *
 * Arguments: None
 *
 * Return Value: None
 *
 * Example:
 * [] call ghost_airdefence_fnc_plan
