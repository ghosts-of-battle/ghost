/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * Infantry guarding one battery.
 *
 * They stand OFF the hardware, not on it - a ring out from the radar rather
 * than a huddle around it. A player who has found the site should still have to
 * deal with somebody before walking onto it, and guards standing between the
 * launchers would just be killed by whatever kills the launchers.
 *
 * Profiled like everything else here, so a guarded site costs the same as an
 * unguarded one while nobody is near it.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: The battery's position <ARRAY>
 * 1: The side <SIDE>
 * 2: Man classes to draw from <ARRAY>
 * 3: Markers never to place on <ARRAY>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * How many groups were made <NUMBER>
 *
 * Example:
 * [_pos, east, _kinds, _black] call ghost_airdefence_fnc_buildSecurity
