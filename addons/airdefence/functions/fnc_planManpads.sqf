/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * MANPAD teams for one asymmetric commander.
 *
 * A guerrilla does not field a battery. Two or three men with a launcher,
 * placed off the objective where they can see the approach, is both what an
 * insurgency actually does and the thing players can plausibly hunt - a radar
 * site would be a fortress they have no answer to.
 *
 * They do NOT need open ground. A shooter wants cover; only the sky above him
 * has to be clear, and there is no way to stand under a tree and still be
 * usable to a pilot's eye anyway.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: The side <SIDE>
 * 1: Its objectives, biggest first <ARRAY>
 * 2: Its TAOR markers <ARRAY>
 * 3: Markers never to build on <ARRAY>
 * 4: [radar, launchers, manpad, mag] <ARRAY>
 * 5: The commander's faction, for who mans the teams <STRING>
 *
 * Return Value: None
 *
 * Public: No
