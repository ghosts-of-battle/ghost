/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * Radar-and-launcher batteries for one conventional commander.
 *
 * OPEN GROUND, AND ONLY OPEN GROUND. A radar in a wood sees nothing and a
 * launcher in a street is a decoration, so the clear radius is deliberately
 * large and the slope limit tight. If a map cannot satisfy that, the site is
 * skipped and said so - a battery standing in a hedge is worse than none.
 *
 * IN THE TAOR, AND ONLY THE TAOR. The site is checked after it is chosen, not
 * just the objective it grew from: findSite searches a ring around a centre,
 * so an objective near a boundary will happily offer ground on the far side of
 * it.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: The side <SIDE>
 * 1: Its objectives, biggest first <ARRAY>
 * 2: Its TAOR markers <ARRAY>
 * 3: Markers never to build on <ARRAY>
 * 4: [radar, launchers, manpad, mag] <ARRAY>
 * 5: Sites already placed this run, to stand clear of <ARRAY>
 * 6: The commander's faction, for who mans the guards <STRING>
 *
 * Return Value: None
 *
 * Public: No
