/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * Builds one battery: a radar, and launchers set back from it.
 *
 * Everything is crewed and PROFILED. An uncrewed static is scenery - a SAM
 * with nobody on it never fires - and an unprofiled one is a live AI sitting
 * on the server for the whole mission whether anybody is near it or not.
 *
 * The site is recorded by POSITION, not by object. Profiling deletes the
 * hardware and ALiVE makes new objects when a player comes near, so anything
 * holding object references would be pointing at deleted vehicles within
 * minutes. A site is a place.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Where <ARRAY>
 * 1: Owning side <SIDE>
 * 2: [radar, launchers, manpad, mag] <ARRAY>
 * 3: The side's TAOR markers <ARRAY>
 * 4: Markers never to build on <ARRAY>
 * 5: Man classes for the security groups <ARRAY>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * It was built <BOOL>
