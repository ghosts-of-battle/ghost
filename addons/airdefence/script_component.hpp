// A TEMPORARY SYSTEM, on purpose. ALiVE places air defence itself and ghost's
// standing rule is to feed ALiVE rather than duplicate it - but ALiVE 3's
// version is not stable yet, so this stands in until it is. Nothing else is
// built on top of it and it is expected to be deleted, not grown.

// How the two kinds of commander are answered. A conventional commander -
// invasion or occupation - gets a radar cueing launchers set back from it. An
// asymmetric one gets men with MANPADS, because a guerrilla does not field a
// battery and a battery is not something players can quietly walk past.
