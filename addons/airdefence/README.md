Places air defence for every ALiVE commander on the map.

Everything placed is profiled, so it costs nothing while nobody is near it.<br>Batteries Per Side - conventional commanders only, asymmetric get none Launchers Per Battery - set back from the radar that cues them Battery Spacing (m) - least distance between two batteries Radar Class / Launcher Class / MANPAD Weapon - leave blank to pick from each commander's own faction Clear Ground (m) - open ground a battery needs; a radar in a wood sees nothing MANPAD Teams Per Side - asymmetric commanders only
