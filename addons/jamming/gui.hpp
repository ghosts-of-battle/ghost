// THE JAMMING METER'S THREE CONTROLS, AS ROOT-LEVEL CLASSES FOR ctrlCreate.
//
// THE RESOURCE THIS REPLACES NEVER EXISTED. FUNC(jamHud) raised
// "ghost_jamming_jamHud" with cutRsc from the day it was written, and no
// RscTitles class of that name was ever in the config - so every pass inside a
// jam field was a "Resource title ... not found" warning in the RPT, two
// seconds apart, and no meter. Building the missing title layer was the
// obvious repair and the wrong one: a cutRsc layer survives the mission that
// raised it, which is how the hacking scanner sat over the main menu for eight
// builds - addons/hud/gui.hpp tells that story in full. The meter's controls
// are created on the MISSION DISPLAY (findDisplay 46) instead, which the
// engine destroys with the mission.
//
// NO POSITIONS IN HERE. FUNC(jamHud) places everything off
// EFUNC(common,hudPos) each time it builds the meter - the same bespoke store
// the hacking strip still uses.
