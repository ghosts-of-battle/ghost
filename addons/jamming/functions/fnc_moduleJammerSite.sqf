/*
 * Author: YonV
 * One placed jammer site: builds the emitter where the module stands and, if
 * asked, arms the artillery that answers anybody who loiters in its field.
 *
 * PLACED, NOT SPREAD. Sites used to be scattered over an ALiVE commander's
 * objective list by FUNC(spawnObjectiveJammers) - the mission maker chose how
 * many and never chose where, and Zeus could not put one down at all. This is
 * the same site builder, FUNC(spawnJammerSite), given a position by hand.
 *
 * IT WAITS FOR THE JAMMING MODULE. The radius bounds, the burn-through
 * reference and the GPS domain are that module's, and a site built before it
 * has read them would roll its reach from preInit defaults. Module functions
 * have no ordering guarantee between them, so a site placed in Eden alongside
 * the enable arms on the first frame that has one.
 *
 * NO JAMMING MODULE, NO SITE. Placing this alone is a mission that has asked
 * for an emitter without turning the system on; it says so rather than building
 * a mast that denies nothing.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: The module logic <OBJECT>
 * 1: Synchronised units <ARRAY>
 * 2: Activated <BOOL>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * None
 *
 * Public: No
