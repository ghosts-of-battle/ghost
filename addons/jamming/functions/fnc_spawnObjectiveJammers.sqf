/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * Jammer sites at each commander's objectives (new.md section 1.3).
 *
 * A data site at the biggest objectives and a radio site at the rest - the size
 * of the ground being guarded decides which service goes quiet around it. The
 * terminal IS the zone: hack it or destroy it and the zone dies immediately and
 * permanently, which is what makes it worth walking to. One GPS uplink on the
 * whole map, at the first commander's biggest objective.
 *
 * Every terminal joins the hacking tower pool through the jamming registry, so
 * they are hackable with no further wiring.
 *
 * IT IS SPREAD ACROSS FRAMES, and that is not a nicety. Placing every site in
 * one blocking loop froze the 14:48 run for 3m47s: thirty-one commanders on
 * that mission, eight sites each, and every site does a findSite search and a
 * createVehicle. The work is unchanged - it is drained a few per frame now, so
 * a big order of battle costs a longer wait instead of a dead server.
 *
 * The cost that actually caused that freeze was registering all 248 sites as
 * ALiVE objectives; that is gone, and only the uplink is registered - see
 * FUNC(spawnJammerSite). This is the belt to that braces: the search and the
 * spawn were always going to scale with the objective count, and nothing had
 * ever bounded them per frame.
 *
 * Arguments: None
 *
 * Return Value:
 * Sites QUEUED <NUMBER> - not placed. Placing finishes frames later, and the
 * drain logs the final count when it empties.
 *
 * Public: No
