Function: ghost_jamming_fnc_jamHud

Description:
    Shows the jamming meter while the player is in a field, hides it when clear.
    Reads the four figures the jam loop already published - the meter never
    evaluates jamming a second time, so it cannot disagree with what the radios,
    the handset and the map are actually doing.

    ONE ROW PER DOMAIN (user, 2026-08-31): RADIO, DATA, GPS. A single bar
    stopped meaning anything the moment the terminal could take the net without
    touching TAC//MSG - a player read 60% and could not tell what they had lost.
    All three rows are drawn whenever the meter is up, dim and empty for a
    domain that is clear, so the answer to "what still works" is one glance
    rather than three experiments.

    ON THE MISSION DISPLAY, NOT A TITLE LAYER. The first shape of this cut an
    RscTitles resource that was never defined, so every pass inside a jam field
    was a "Resource title ghost_jamming_jamHud not found" warning two seconds
    apart, and no meter. The honest fix was not to add the missing class: a
    title layer survives the mission that raised it, which is the main-menu bug
    the HUD and the scanner were both rebuilt to end - addons/hud/gui.hpp tells
    it in full. Display 46 is created with the mission and destroyed with it,
    so the meter cannot outlive the world it is reporting on. No display yet
    means the mission is still coming up, and the two-second beat retries.

    THE LABEL SPEAKS THE HUD TILE'S OWN BAND WORDS - DEGRADED, and SMOTHERED
    from 75% - so the meter and the tile can never call the same sky two
    different things.

Parameters (CBA PFH): 0: args, 1: handle
