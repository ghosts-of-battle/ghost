/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * Server PFH: drop dead and hacked emitters from the jammer list, clean up their
 * debug markers, and re-broadcast. A zone dies with its emitter - destroyed OR
 * hacked, either one - which is what lets players silence a zone either loudly
 * or quietly.
 *
 * An abstract zone was born with no object - the temp flag records exactly that
 * - and nothing here can kill it: a temp zone deregisters itself when its
 * duration expires. It used to be tested with `isKindOf "Object"`, and
 * CfgVehicles' Object branch is map furniture - the terminal props are
 * Buildings - so every real emitter failed the test and the first tick threw
 * the whole registry away, temp zones included.
 *
 * Arguments (CBA PFH): unused
 *
 * Return Value: None
 *
 * Public: No
