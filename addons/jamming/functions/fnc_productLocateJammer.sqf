 * LOCATE JAMMER: the emitters holding the quiet up, plotted exactly.
 *
 * Exact rather than fuzzed, and for the same reason LOCATE AA is: a jammer is
 * a thing you go and switch off, and the work of finding it was paid for by
 * getting into the tower. What it buys is a choice - hack it and the zone
 * dies quietly, or blow it and everyone knows you were there.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Where the hack happened <ARRAY>
 * 1: Asking side <SIDE>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * Anything plotted <BOOL>
 *
 * Public: No

// located jammer never reached the COP and nobody who was not standing at the

// one site until that site is dead, and files the intel through
