Function: ghost_jamming_fnc_spawnZoneAt

Description:
    Registers one EW zone at a known point, with or without a destructible
    emitter to hold it up.

    FUNC(spawnJammers) scatters emitters at random inside a TAOR, which is right
    for atmosphere and wrong for anything that has to sit on a particular thing -
    a base, a convoy, an objective. This is the same registry entry placed
    deliberately, so another addon can put a zone somewhere without learning the
    index contract or duplicating the propagation model.

    With an emitter class, the zone dies when the object does, via the usual
    prune loop - so players can silence it by destroying it, which is the whole
    reason EW zones have objects at all. With no class it is abstract and
    permanent: nothing to find, nothing to kill.

    The propagation model is stamped at spawn, exactly as it is for the module's
    own emitters, so a later attribute change never rewrites a zone already in
    the field.

Parameters:
    _pos    : ARRAY  - centre, in WORLD (AGL) coordinates - what getPosATL and
                       getMarkerPos hand you. Converted internally; the registry
                       stores ASL.
    _radius : NUMBER - outer radius. The full-strength core is the usual fraction.
    _class  : STRING - emitter object class. "" = abstract zone, no object.
    _type   : STRING - "jam" or "detect". Optional, default "jam".
    _domains: ARRAY  - which of DOM_RADIO / DOM_DATA / DOM_GPS this zone denies.
                       Optional, default DOM_DEFAULT - radio and data, which is
                       what one emitter denied before the domains existed, so a
                       caller written before the split places the zone it meant.

Returns:
    ARRAY - [_id, _object]. _object is objNull for an abstract zone; _id is ""
            on failure.

Example:
    [_basePos, 900, "Land_TTowerBig_2_F"] call ghost_jamming_fnc_spawnZoneAt
