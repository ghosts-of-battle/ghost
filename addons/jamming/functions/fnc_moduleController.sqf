/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * Reads the module and arms jamming. PLACING THE MODULE IS THE ENABLE - with no
 * module this system does nothing at all.
 *
 * THIS MODULE IS THE GLOBAL TUNING. It sets what is true of every jamming field
 * on the map - burn-through, the rolled radius bounds, the GPS domain.
 *
 * WHERE a jammer stands has TWO answers here, and they add up rather than
 * replace each other. A Ghost - Jammer Site module is one emitter placed on the
 * spot by a mission maker or a Zeus, and it works whether or not ALiVE is
 * running. On top of that, when the adapter is loaded and its commanders are
 * up, FUNC(spawnObjectiveJammers) spreads emitters over a share of each
 * commander's objectives - the three attributes below are that half's tuning
 * and do nothing without ALiVE.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: The module logic <OBJECT>
 * 1: Synchronised units <ARRAY>
 * 2: Activated <BOOL>
 *
 * Return Value: None
 *
 * Public: No
