Function: ghost_jamming_fnc_gpsDrift

Description:
    Walks the GPS sphere across the map, and takes it down when its uplink dies.
    Server only. Started once per sphere by FUNC(spawnGpsUplink) and reschedules
    itself until the sphere is gone.

    IT MOVES, AND THAT IS THE POINT. A static GPS field is a place you learn and
    then route around. A wandering one is weather: it arrives, the map stops
    telling you where you are, and it leaves - and the only way to stop it
    happening again is to find the uplink steering it.

    A RANDOM WALK, NOT A PATROL. The heading holds for several ticks and then
    re-rolls, so the sphere drifts rather than jittering, and nobody can read a
    pattern off two crossings. It turns at the world edge instead of clamping,
    because a sphere that parks on the coastline is a static field again.

    IT IS MOVED ON THE SERVER AND PUBLISHED, not computed live on each client
    from a seed. The registry is a few dozen entries and this fires once every
    GPS_DRIFT_TICK seconds; a deterministic position would save a broadcast that
    costs nothing and would put a second copy of the movement rule in
    FUNC(jamFactor), where every consumer would then have to agree with it.

Parameters:
    _id : STRING - the sphere's zone id.

Returns:
    Nothing.
