Function: ghost_jamming_fnc_spawnGpsUplink

Description:
    Stands up the GPS denial: one ground uplink at an enemy objective, and the
    wandering sphere overhead that the uplink steers.

    TWO ZONES, ONE SWITCH. The uplink is an ordinary emitter - a real object at
    a real place, hackable and destructible like the hub and the terminal, and
    plotted by LOCATE JAMMER because it lives in the same registry every other
    consumer already walks. The sphere is abstract: nothing to find, nothing to
    shoot, drifting over the map on its own. Killing the uplink kills the
    sphere with it (see FUNC(gpsDrift)), which is the whole shape of the thing -
    GPS denial is the one field a player cannot walk out of, so it has to have
    somewhere to be walked INTO instead.

    WHY THE SPHERE IS ABSTRACT AND NOT A PROP. It is space-based. Putting an
    object under it would be a lie the players could shoot, and would anchor a
    thing that is supposed to wander.

    ONE PER SIDE, NOT ONE PER OBJECTIVE. The hub and terminal scale with the
    objective count because a comms net is many masts; a constellation is not.
    A commander gets one uplink or none.

Parameters:
    _side   : SIDE   - the commander this uplink belongs to.
    _pos    : ARRAY  - where the uplink stands, AGL.

Returns:
    ARRAY - [_uplinkId, _sphereId], both "" on failure.
