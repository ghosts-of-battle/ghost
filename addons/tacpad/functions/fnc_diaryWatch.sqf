/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * Hides every panel while the map's diary or briefing pane is open, and brings
 * them back when it closes.
 *
 * The diary is the addon list, the briefing, the tasks and the credits - the
 * pages behind the tabs at the top left of the map. It opens over the same
 * screen the tacpad lives on, and a squad rail sitting on top of your addon
 * list is worse than no squad rail.
 *
 * HIDDEN, NOT MOVED. The diary is transient: reserving that much of the screen
 * permanently would ruin the layout for the ninety-odd percent of the time it
 * is shut, and shoving four panels somewhere else and back again would leave
 * the player hunting for them.
 *
 * The pane is found by asking the display for its diary controls rather than by
 * naming an idc - the tab list and the page body are both standard map controls
 * and either being visible means the player is reading, not navigating.
 *
 * Arguments (CBA per-frame handler):
 * 0: Arguments <ARRAY> - unused
 * 1: Handle <NUMBER> - unused
 *
 * Return Value:
 * None
 *
 * Public: No
