#include "script_component.hpp"
/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * Redraws a panel's contents in place, without touching its frame or its
 * position. A panel that has changed what it is showing - a reader that has
 * opened a thread, a roster that has lost a man - asks for this rather than
 * rebuilding itself, so the frame and its placement all
 * survive the redraw.
 *
 * With no id it redraws every open panel, which is what a theme change and a
 * settings change both want.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Panel id, "" for all of them <STRING> (optional, default "")
 *
 * Return Value:
 * None
 *
 * Example:
 * ["reader"] call ghost_tacpad_fnc_rebuild
 *
 * Public: Yes
