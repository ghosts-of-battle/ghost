/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * An RGBA array as the hex the design writes its tokens in - #F3F2F2.
 *
 * The settings screen shows the three tokens a scheme is made of, and a colour
 * shown as "0.953,0.949,0.949" is a colour nobody can compare against the swatch
 * beside it. FUNC(theme) reads hex back in, so this is the other half of one
 * round trip rather than a second way of writing a colour down.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: RGBA, 0-1 each <ARRAY>
 * 1: Include the leading hash <BOOL> (optional, default true)
 *
 * Return Value:
 * Hex <STRING>
 *
 * Example:
 * private _hex = [[0.925, 0.188, 0.075, 1]] call ghost_tacpad_fnc_hexOf
 *
 * Public: Yes
