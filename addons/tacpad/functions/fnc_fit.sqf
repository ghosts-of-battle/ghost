#include "script_component.hpp"
/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * Shrinks a panel to the content it just drew.
 *
 * Panels used to be fixed-size boxes from their defaults, so a squad of one got
 * a half-screen rail and an empty reader was a wall of white over the map. A
 * panel now says how many rows it used and the frame closes up to fit.
 *
 * The placed WIDTH is kept - width is part of where a panel was put, height is
 * a consequence of the content.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Panel id <STRING>
 * 1: Rows used <NUMBER>
 * 2: Extra height beyond the rows, in safe-zone fractions <NUMBER> (optional, default 0)
 *
 * Return Value:
 * None
 *
 * Example:
 * ["squad", 12] call ghost_tacpad_fnc_fit
 *
 * Public: Yes
