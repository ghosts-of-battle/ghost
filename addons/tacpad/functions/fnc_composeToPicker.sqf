/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * The addressee picker, drawn into the compose pane: every net, squad and man
 * this message can be sent to, one per row.
 *
 * THE RAIL IS THE SELECTOR, THIS IS THE REST. Pressing a net on the left rail
 * retargets an open message - see the rail handler in FUNC(readerDraw) - and that
 * is how a net is chosen, which is what the rail is already a list of. It cannot
 * offer a PERSON, though, and it cannot offer a net this player is not currently
 * reading, so CHANGE opens the full set here rather than putting fourteen chips
 * back across the top of the pane.
 *
 * ONE ADDRESSEE. A press replaces the address rather than adding to it, because
 * "who is this for" has one answer and everybody else on it is a CC - which is
 * the row directly under the TO line.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: [x, width, top y] of the pane, in the content group's own coordinates <ARRAY>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * None
 *
 * Public: No
