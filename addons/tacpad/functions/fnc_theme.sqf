/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * The colour set every panel paints itself with. Four tokens and nothing else:
 * ground, ink, accent and line. No control anywhere hard-codes a hex, which is
 * what makes a scheme change a repaint rather than a rebuild - and what makes
 * adding a scheme later one entry in this switch.
 *
 * THESE ARE THE DESIGN'S OWN COLOURS, not the player's Arma interface colours.
 * Reading their profile was tried and dropped: it made the tacpad a different
 * mod on every machine, and the near-white ink most people run turned every
 * divider and tile border into a white cage over the map. The suite is set in
 * one palette so it reads as one thing.
 *
 * LIGHT is the Modernist ground the design was drawn on - near-mono red on
 * light grey. DARK is its night ground, for the same reason a map has a night
 * mode: a light panel at 0200 is a torch in the face.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Token - "ground", "ink", "accent", "line", or "" for all four <STRING> (optional, default "")
 *
 * Return Value:
 * RGBA <ARRAY>, or [ground, ink, accent, line] when no token is named
 *
 * Example:
 * private _ink = ["ink"] call ghost_tacpad_fnc_theme
 *
 * Public: Yes
