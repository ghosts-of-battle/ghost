#include "script_component.hpp"
/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * Opens an app full size over the map. This is what a live tile does when it is
 * clicked, and it is the only route in - a tile never opens anything itself, so
 * there is one place that knows how an app is shown.
 *
 * An app that is not loaded is a no-op rather than an error. The suite is meant
 * to be assembled from whatever addons a mission has, and a tile for a missing
 * app should sit there inert, not throw.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: App id, matching a registered app <STRING>
 * 1: Arguments passed to the app <ANY> (optional, default [])
 * 2: A human asked for this, not a screen that was open a moment ago <BOOL>
 *    (optional, default false). A reopen - a refresh loop's direct call, a
 *    press inside the app that queued one for next frame - belongs to the
 *    window that scheduled it, and the moment that window is gone the reopen
 *    is a ghost. The panels and tiles are the only humans; they pass true.
 *
 * Return Value:
 * Opened <BOOL>
 *
 * Example:
 * ["squad"] call ghost_tacpad_fnc_openApp
 *
 * Public: Yes
