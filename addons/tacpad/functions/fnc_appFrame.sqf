/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * The chrome every full-size app is drawn in: a centred panel over the map, an
 * inverted title bar with CLOSE at its right, and an empty body handed back.
 *
 * One copy. Each app used to build its own group, border, ground, header, title
 * and close button, which is three transcriptions of the same forty lines and
 * three places for the frame to drift - two of them were still setting a 1.45
 * font height and painting their border in the divider colour long after the
 * panels had stopped.
 *
 * Only ONE app is open at a time and opening a second replaces the first. The
 * map is underneath and stays the point; a stack of windows over it is a desktop.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Map display <DISPLAY>
 * 1: Title <STRING>
 * 2: Width in safe-zone fractions <NUMBER> (optional, default 0.34)
 * 3: Height in safe-zone fractions <NUMBER> (optional, default 0.56)
 * 4: Scrolling body <BOOL> (optional, default false)
 *
 * Return Value:
 * 0: The app's group <CONTROL>
 * 1: The body to fill <CONTROL>
 *
 * Example:
 * ([_display, "SQUAD STATUS", 0.5, 0.6] call ghost_tacpad_fnc_appFrame) params ["_group", "_body"]
 *
 * Public: Yes

// of height, so past the text size where the line outgrows the header bar the

// between. That press died silently: the button was deleted holding it, the
// labels and the bottom net underneath never saw it, and the window "would
// not close" - on every app with a live loop, however many nets were laid
// UNDER a control that eats from ABOVE. The down cannot be raced: whatever
