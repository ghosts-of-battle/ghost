/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * The transparent button that makes a drawn thing pressable, laid over the top
 * of it and carrying the handler.
 *
 * STRUCTURED TEXT EATS THE PRESS. This is the second half of the input story and
 * the one that cost a fortnight: a structured text control takes mouse input -
 * it has to, it can carry links - and it does not raise ButtonClick, so a label
 * lying over a button is a hole in that button. Where a label covered most of a
 * cell, the cell answered only in the margins around it; the settings strip,
 * whose label runs from the gear to the far edge, answered only on the gear.
 * "Only the icon is clickable" is exactly what that looks like.
 *
 * So every label already drawn INSIDE this button's rectangle is given a press
 * handler that fires this button's own handler, with this button as the caller -
 * which is what the handlers all read their data off. Nothing double-fires: one
 * control receives a press, and if the button gets it the label never sees it.
 *
 * It works with no change at any call site because the vocabulary already draws
 * in that order everywhere - fill, frame, text, and the hit last.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Parent <CONTROL>
 * 1: Position [x, y, w, h], relative to the parent <ARRAY>
 * 2: Called with [control] when clicked <CODE>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * The button, so the caller can hang its own data on it <CONTROL>
 *
 * Example:
 * private _hit = [_body, [0, _y, _w, _h], {...}] call ghost_tacpad_fnc_drawHit
 *
 * Public: Yes
