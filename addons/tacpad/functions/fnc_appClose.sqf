#include "script_component.hpp"
/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * Closes whatever app is open on the map, from anywhere.
 *
 * THE ONE TEARDOWN. There used to be several - the frame's own CLOSE, the
 * ground's header-band net, a floating panic button, a FORCE CLOSE strip -
 * each with its own copy of the same four steps and its own way of getting
 * one of them wrong. A page closes the same way whoever asks: the group
 * goes, the marker clears, the panels come back.
 *
 * IT SWEEPS FOR ORPHANS TOO. Deleting only the tracked handle is what let a
 * page get stuck: a group the suite lost its reference to is deleted by
 * nothing and replaced by nothing, so it sits there forever. Every group the
 * suite makes carries QGVAR(owned) - see FUNC(build) - so the display can be
 * swept for our own work and nothing else's, sparing the registered panels
 * because those are not the stuck thing.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * None
 *
 * Return Value:
 * Something was closed <BOOL>
 *
 * Example:
 * [] call ghost_tacpad_fnc_appClose
 *
 * Public: Yes
