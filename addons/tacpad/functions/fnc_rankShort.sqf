 * Author: Ghost
 * A rank as the three letters it is written as on a roster.
 *
 * The engine spells them out - SERGEANT, LIEUTENANT - and a rail 0.15 of the
 * screen wide has no room to spell a rank and then a name after it. Three
 * letters is what a roster uses and what everyone reads anyway.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Rank, as `rank _unit` gives it <STRING>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * Three-letter abbreviation, or the input if it is not a rank <STRING>
 *
 * Example:
 * private _short = [rank player] call ghost_tacpad_fnc_rankShort
 *
 * Public: No
