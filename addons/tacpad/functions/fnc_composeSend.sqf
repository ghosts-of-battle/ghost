/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * Reads the compose pane's answers and submits them.
 *
 * Everything typed has already been harvested off its edit - see
 * FUNC(composeHarvest) - so this is the same job for a pressed answer and a
 * typed one. Only the conversion to what the engine stores happens here.
 *
 * WITH NO TEMPLATE IT IS A MESSAGE. The plain box sends as the freetext report,
 * which is a real template with a real field, so the thread it opens is the same
 * kind of thing as every other thread and nothing downstream has to special-case
 * it.
 *
 * The engine validates exactly as it would from any other caller. The pane gets
 * no special treatment, because a form that can submit something the API would
 * refuse is a form that lies to the player.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * None
 *
 * Return Value:
 * Sent <BOOL>
 *
 * Example:
 * [] call ghost_tacpad_fnc_composeSend
 *
 * Public: No
