/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * The @ completions under the CC line, rebuilt on every keystroke.
 *
 * IT MUST NOT REDRAW THE PANE. Every other interaction on this screen ends in a
 * FUNC(readerDraw), which throws the whole content group away - and that group
 * holds the box being typed into, its text and the caret in it. So the list is a
 * group of its own, deleted and remade in place: nothing else on the pane is
 * touched, and the player types straight through it.
 *
 * ON KeyUp, NOT KeyDown. The engine puts the character in the box between the
 * two, so a completion built on the way down is always one letter behind what is
 * on screen. FUNC(composeCard) drives its live preview off the same event for the
 * same reason.
 *
 * NEWEST IN THE GROUP IS TOPMOST, which is why the list is created here rather
 * than reserved at draw time: it has to cover the rows it drops over.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: The CC edit <CONTROL>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * None
 *
 * Example:
 * [_cc] call ghost_tacpad_fnc_composeCcDrop
 *
 * Public: No
