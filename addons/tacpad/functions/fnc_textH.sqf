/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * How tall one line of text is at a given size, in safe-zone Y units.
 *
 * A control that holds a label has to be sized off the label, not off a row
 * height that happens to look right on one machine. Text scales with the
 * player's UI scale and with the suite's own text setting; a cell that is a
 * fixed fraction of ROW_H does neither, and at a large UI scale its own border
 * is drawn through the middle of its word.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Size, as a multiple of the body size <NUMBER> (optional, default 1)
 *
 * Return Value:
 * Line height <NUMBER>
 *
 * Example:
 * private _cellH = ([0.9] call ghost_tacpad_fnc_textH) + 2 * _padY
 *
 * Public: Yes
