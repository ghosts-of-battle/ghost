/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * A NET, AS ONE CONVERSATION. Everything filed to this net in the order it was
 * said, with the composer under it addressed to the same net.
 *
 * THIS IS WHAT A NET SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE BEEN. It was a filter: picking HQ
 * narrowed a list of separate threads and you clicked one to read it - so a
 * message sent to HQ was two clicks away from being visible in HQ, which is not
 * how anybody expects a channel to behave. A radio net is everything said on it,
 * in order.
 *
 * THE REPORT'S STATE IS ON THE LINE, not behind it. A CASEVAC is a thing said on
 * the net; its OPEN or CLAIMED state is a chip beside it rather than a folder to
 * open. That was the choice made when this was designed and it is why there is
 * no second level here at all.
 *
 * THE TAGS TRAVEL WITH THE MESSAGE - squad, job and urgency, stamped when it was
 * sent (see EFUNC(messaging,srvSubmit)). Read off the sender now, they would
 * change every time he was promoted or moved.
 *
 * SIDES ARE WHO SPOKE. Incoming sets right, your own sets left, with the indent
 * moving too - so the conversation can be followed without reading a call sign
 * on every line.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Stream, [[message, thread], ...] oldest first <ARRAY>
 * 1: Threads still being fetched <NUMBER>
 * 2: Pane geometry [x, w] <ARRAY>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * None
 *
 * Example:
 * [_stream, 0, [_detailX, _detailW]] call ghost_tacpad_fnc_readerNetView
 *
 * Public: No
