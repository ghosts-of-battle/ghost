/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * The map markers a grid field can be filled from, nearest first.
 *
 * A location on a report is nearly always somewhere already marked - the LZ, the
 * objective, the rally - and typing a grid off the map by hand is where a digit
 * gets dropped. This is the list behind the MARKER button.
 *
 * ONLY PLAYER-PLACED MARKERS are offered - the user's rule for every marker
 * list in the suite. Editor zones, TAOR areas, module art and the suite's
 * own ghost_* overlays are all out wholesale by the same test.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Maximum returned <NUMBER> (optional, default 12)
 *
 * Return Value:
 * [[label, position], ...] <ARRAY>
 *
 * Example:
 * [8] call ghost_tacpad_fnc_markerGrids
 *
 * Public: No
