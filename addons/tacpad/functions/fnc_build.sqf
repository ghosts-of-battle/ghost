#include "script_component.hpp"
/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * Builds one panel on the map display: outline, ground, header, title, meta,
 * body - then hands the body to the panel's own builder and never looks inside
 * it.
 *
 * PANELS DO NOT MOVE, and there is nothing here to move them with. Every
 * panel is where FUNC(place) puts it: its default, clamped into the safe
 * zone and pushed clear of the reserved regions. Panel geometry is set in
 * the DEFAULT_* defines in shared.inc.hpp and nowhere else, so changing one
 * changes it for everybody rather than for whoever last touched a mouse.
 *
 * The frame is an outline of four 2px edges around the ground, not a filled
 * rectangle with a smaller one on top. Same picture when the panel is opaque,
 * but it is the only version that still reads as an outline at less than full
 * opacity - and panel opacity is a setting.
 *
 * ONE HEADER TREATMENT: ink on the panel's own ground, over a 2px rule. The
 * reader used to take an inverted bar - ink fill, ground text - because that is
 * how the design draws it on the light scheme. On the night ground that inverts
 * with everything else and the reader wore a solid white cap while the panels
 * either side of it were dark, which reads as a panel that missed the scheme
 * change rather than as emphasis.
 *
 * Only the header takes mouse input. A click in the body has to reach whatever
 * the panel put there, and a frame that swallowed clicks would make every list
 * in the suite unusable.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Map display <DISPLAY>
 * 1: Panel record <HASHMAP>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * The body control the panel should fill <CONTROL>
 *
 * Public: No
