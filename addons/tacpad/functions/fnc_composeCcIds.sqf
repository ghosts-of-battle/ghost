/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * The CC line, turned into mailbox ids.
 *
 * THE LINE IS NAMES, THE SEND IS IDS. The player types "@HQ, @REAPER, @SGT DOE"
 * because that is what those things are called on the rail and on the roster; the
 * engine addresses B:, G: and P: ids - see EFUNC(messaging,submit). The
 * conversion happens once, here, so the visible line stays readable and the
 * addressees stay correct.
 *
 * A NAME NOBODY ANSWERS TO IS DROPPED, not passed through. Submit treats an
 * unrecognised string as a shared mailbox name, so a typo would file the report
 * in a net that does not exist and nobody would ever see it - the CC would look
 * like it worked. An id typed or pasted in full is honoured as it stands.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: The CC line as typed <STRING>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * Mailbox ids <ARRAY> of <STRING>
 *
 * Example:
 * private _cc = [ghost_tacpad_composeCc] call ghost_tacpad_fnc_composeCcIds
 *
 * Public: Yes
