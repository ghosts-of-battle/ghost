 * Author: Ghost
 * The composer under a NET conversation: quick phrases, and the way into the
 * full card.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY NOT THE THREAD COMPOSER. That one answers a thread - its quick
 * replies are the ones the thread's own template says are legal. This one
 * addresses a NET, so every phrase is free text rather than a template the
 * thread's state has to allow.
 *
 * A QUICK REPLY ANSWERS WHAT IS ON THE SCREEN (user, 2026-09-03: "quick replies
 * start new messages"). A net view is a conversation - the whole net in the
 * order it was said - so pressing ROGER under it means ROGER TO THAT, the way it
 * means it on a radio. It opened a new thread instead, which put a bare "ROGER"
 * on the net attached to nothing and left the message it was answering
 * unanswered.
 *
 * So the newest thread on the net comes in and the phrases reply into it. With
 * NOTHING on the net there is nothing to answer and a new thread is right - that
 * is the empty-stream call in FUNC(readerNetView), which passes "".
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Pane geometry [x, w] <ARRAY>
 * 1: Y the composer starts at <NUMBER>
 * 2: Thread the quick phrases answer, "" to open a new one <STRING> (optional, default "")
 *
 * Return Value:
 * None
 *
 * Public: No
