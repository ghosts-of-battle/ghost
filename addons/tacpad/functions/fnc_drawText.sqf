/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * One line of text, in one of the system's type roles.
 *
 * Every panel used to build its own <t> tag with format, which is how five
 * panels ended up with five different ideas of what a kicker looks like. The
 * roles are the design's: a micro-label, a value, a subject, a detail line.
 *
 * THE LINE IS CENTRED IN THE RECTANGLE IT IS GIVEN. Structured text renders at
 * the top of its control, so a label in a row-height box sits against the row
 * above it with all the air underneath - which is what made the roster read as
 * gappy and the tool cells look mispositioned. The caller hands over the box the
 * text belongs in and gets the text in the middle of it.
 *
 * TRACKING IS FAKED. The design sets its micro-labels at 0.16em letter-spacing
 * and Arma's structured text has no letter-spacing at all, so a tracked label is
 * drawn with a space between each character. It is only ever asked for on the
 * short uppercase kickers - WEATHER, FLASH, SQUAD - because on a sentence it
 * would be both unreadable and far too wide.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Parent <CONTROL>
 * 1: Position [x, y, w, h], relative to the parent <ARRAY>
 * 2: Text <STRING>
 * 3: RGBA <ARRAY>
 * 4: Size, as a multiple of the body size <NUMBER> (optional, default 1)
 * 5: Bold <BOOL> (optional, default false)
 * 6: Alignment - "left", "right" or "center" <STRING> (optional, default "left")
 * 7: Track the letters, and uppercase them <BOOL> (optional, default false)
 *
 * Return Value:
 * The control <CONTROL>
 *
 * Example:
 * [_body, [_pad, 0, _w, _rowH], "WEATHER", _ink, 0.8, true, "left", true] call ghost_tacpad_fnc_drawText
 *
 * Public: Yes
