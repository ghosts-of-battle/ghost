 * Is it safe to redraw the open app right now?
 *
 * THIS IS THE ANSWER TO "THE APP PAGES WILL NOT TAKE A CLICK". A live app keeps
 * up with its subject by REOPENING itself on a timer, and opening an app deletes
 * the previous group and builds a new one - see FUNC(appFrame). So a screen with
 * a one-second loop was destroying and recreating every button on it once a
 * second, and a control deleted between the press and the release NEVER raises a
 * click. Pressing anything on INTRUSION, TIMER or the scanner was a coin toss,
 * and a slow press lost every time.
 *
 * Fixing the loops' variable names is what re-enabled that: while they were
 * reading a name nothing wrote, they removed themselves on their first tick and
 * the screens were merely frozen rather than hostile.
 *
 * THE POINTER IS THE TELL. Inside the app the player is aiming at something, so
 * the redraw waits; outside it they are looking, so it goes ahead. A screen
 * therefore updates while it is being read and holds still while it is being
 * used, which is the behaviour a player would describe as "it works".
 *
 * IT IS A HOLD, NOT A STOP, AND THAT DISTINCTION WAS THE BUG. A player watching
 * a progress bar rests the cursor on the window - so the pointer test was true
 * for as long as they were looking at it, the screen never redrew, and the
 * intrusion bar sat at 0% for the whole hack. The hack itself was running
 * perfectly; the screen was a photograph of its first frame.
 *
 * So the hold expires. Three seconds without a redraw and one goes through
 * regardless of where the cursor is: a bar that steps every three seconds is a
 * bar, and a press has to be very unlucky to land in that one frame.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * None
 *
 * Return Value:
 * Safe to redraw <BOOL>
 *
 * Example:
 * if !([] call ghost_tacpad_fnc_appIdle) exitWith {}
 *
 * Public: Yes
