#include "script_component.hpp"
/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * Where a panel actually goes: its default, clamped into the current safe zone
 * and pushed clear of the three regions the design says must never be covered.
 *
 * THE DEFAULT IS THE POSITION. Nothing stores a per-player one and nothing
 * reads one - a panel is where its DEFAULT_* define says, every session, on
 * every machine.
 *
 * The clamp is not politeness. A default written for a 16:9 screen puts a panel
 * off the edge of an ultrawide one, and a panel sitting on the chat overlay
 * costs a player the only text channel they have.
 *
 * Nudged rather than refused: a panel overlapping a reserved zone is slid the
 * shortest way clear.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Panel id <STRING>
 * 1: Default place [x, y, w, h] in safe-zone fractions <ARRAY>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * 0: Screen position [x, y, w, h] ready for ctrlSetPosition <ARRAY>
 * 1: The fractions it settled on <ARRAY>
 *
 * Example:
 * (["squad", DEFAULT_SQUAD] call ghost_tacpad_fnc_place) params ["_pos", "_fr"]
 *
 * Public: No
