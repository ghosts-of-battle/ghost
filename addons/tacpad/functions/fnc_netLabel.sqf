#include "script_component.hpp"
/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * A comma-separated addressee list, in the words the player picked it by.
 *
 * B:HQ IS NOT AN ADDRESS ANYBODY SPEAKS. The pane holds ids because the engine
 * addresses ids, but a line reading "TO B:HQ, P:76561198012345678" is a debug
 * readout - so the address is drawn through here and reads "HQ, SGT DOE".
 *
 * AN ID OFF THE LIST STILL PRINTS. A man who has left, or a box this player does
 * not read, has no label to look up, and is shown rather than dropped - a target
 * silently missing from the TO line is a message going somewhere the sender
 * cannot see. A box or a group carries its own name and prints it; a man carries
 * only a uid, so he is looked up by it, and reads DIRECT when even that fails.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Addressee ids, comma separated <STRING>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * Readable list <STRING>
 *
 * Example:
 * private _who = [ghost_tacpad_composeTo] call ghost_tacpad_fnc_netLabel
 *
 * Public: Yes
