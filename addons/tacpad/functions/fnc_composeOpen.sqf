#include "script_component.hpp"
/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * Puts the reader's right pane into compose. Opens the reader first if it is not
 * already up, so NEW off the docked rail lands on the same screen as NEW off the
 * full one.
 *
 * IT IS NOT A WINDOW. Composing used to be a second dialog over the top of the
 * reader, which put the thread being answered behind the answer and made
 * sending a report an act that closed the traffic it was about. The pane the
 * thread was in is the pane the reply is written in.
 *
 * THE MESSAGE IS THE DEFAULT. Opening with no template gives a plain message
 * box; a report is INSERTED from there with the TEMPLATE button. It opened on an
 * empty picker before - a screen that would not let you type a word until you
 * had chosen a form.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Thread to reply into, "" for a new message <STRING> (optional, default "")
 * 1: Template to open with, "" for the plain message box <STRING> (optional, default "")
 * 2: Open on the template picker <BOOL> (optional, default false)
 * 3: Addressees for a new message, "" for the current net <STRING> (optional, default "")
 * 4: Answers to start with, as [key, value] pairs <ARRAY> (optional, default [])
 *
 * Return Value:
 * Opened <BOOL>
 *
 * Example:
 * ["", "", true] call ghost_tacpad_fnc_composeOpen
 *
 * Public: Yes
