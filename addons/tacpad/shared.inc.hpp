// The vanilla map's own top bar - mission name, player slot, the icon row and

// nothing between them, and the squad rail needed half the screen to show four

//
// It was 1.45, which put the design's own type sizes on screen almost exactly -

// each other. What is left is 0.562 of the safe zone, and six tiles fit it -
// see TILE_W, which was trimmed by four thousandths to make them.

// y 0.20; nothing lives left of the old band edge at tile height) to seat the
// SUPPORT tile - the user's call: compress a little, expand left if needed.
// 0.60, and the band ALSO self-clamps against the reader's placed edge in

// THE STRIP UNDER THE READER: three buttons, edge to edge across the reader's

//
// NONE OF THE THREE HAS A TITLE BAR. They are buttons, not panels - a header
// reading SETTINGS over a cell reading SETTINGS is the same word twice, and on a
// control this short the bar was half its height. They are registered chromeless
// (see FUNC(register)), which is also what lets three of them fit in the space
// two of them used to need.
//
// The gear sits directly under the reader, which is what makes it findable:
// settings for the suite live where the suite is, not in a menu three layers
// down.
// THREE STRIPS IN THE SAME RUN, 0.72 to 0.99, four thousandths apart. A

// button to rescue.

//
