 * Author: Ghost
 * The one detection roll, for every way of being noticed.
 *
 * Degrees (new.md section 2):
 *   not detected      nothing happens, and nothing is said. A system that
 *                     announces its own passes teaches players to read the
 *                     chat instead of the ground.
 *   detected, clean   SMALL - a silent flag. THE PLAYER IS NOT TOLD. That is
 *                     the whole mechanic: walk away and you are fine, try
 *                     again and you find out.
 *   detected, flagged MAJOR - the full reply.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: The player caught <OBJECT>
 * 1: Source tag - "hack", "drone", "radio" <STRING>
 *
 * Return Value: None
 *
 * Public: No
