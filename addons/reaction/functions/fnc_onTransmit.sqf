 * A key-up on this client. Filtered here, locally, so only a DETECTABLE
 * transmission costs the server an event.
 *
 * SATCOM IS EXEMPT (new.md section 2), and the test is ACRE's own antenna
 * connection rather than a flag ghost keeps - a set talking to a satellite is
 * not radiating across the valley, and that is the point of carrying one.
 *
 * Power: ACRE knows the live channel's transmit power in milliwatts. TFAR has
 * no equivalent, so its long-range sets - the only ones that reach here - are
 * treated as above any sane threshold, which is what they are.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Radio id or class <STRING>
 *
 * Return Value: None
 *
 * Public: No
