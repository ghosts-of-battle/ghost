/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * The objective-lost-grade reply (new.md section 2): shells from the hostile
 * commander's own guns, a drone sent to look, and the neighbourhood told.
 *
 * ASKED FOR, NOT CONJURED. The shells are an ARTY_REQUEST to a real commander
 * with real batteries - if none is in range, none arrive, and the fallback
 * barrage only fires when there is no commander to ask at all. The drone
 * comes out of that side's ceiling, so a force whose supply was raided
 * answers thinly.
 *
 * Throttled per player: five failed retries are one discovery.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: The player <OBJECT>
 * 1: Source tag <STRING>
 *
 * Return Value: None
 *
 * Public: No
