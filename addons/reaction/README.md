# Reaction

`ghost_reaction`

The one consequence path. A failed hack, a drone that actually saw you, and a
transmission over the wattage threshold all roll the same degrees:

* **nothing** - and it is never announced. A system that reports its own
  passes teaches players to read the chat instead of the ground.
* **SMALL** - a *silent* flag. You are not told. Walk away and it decays;
  try again and your fail *and* detect chances are trebled.
* **MAJOR** - shells asked of the hostile commander's own guns, a drone sent
  to look (out of that side's cache-limited ceiling), and every AI within a
  few hundred metres told where you are.

SATCOM is exempt from radio detection, tested through ACRE's own antenna
connection rather than a flag ghost keeps. TFAR squad sets never reach the
filter at all.

    #ghostreact    flag and cooldown counts, and whether you are flagged

### Ghost - Enemy Reaction

`ghost_moduleReaction`, category ghost_modules

Placing this module turns on enemy reaction. Without it, the system is off.<br>Hack Fail Chance (%) - Chance an intrusion fails outright Detection Chance (%) - Chance a failure, a drone sighting or a transmission is noticed Barrage Rounds Min - Fewest shells a major response puts down Barrage Rounds Max - Most shells Radio Watts Watched - Transmit power at or above which a radio can be direction-found
