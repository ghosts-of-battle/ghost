# Radio Mesh

`ghost_radio_mesh`

The ACRE2 radios are a mesh. A transmission that cannot reach a receiver
directly is carried by friendly radios on the same frequency - as many hops
as it takes - with every leg judged by ACRE's own propagation model (terrain,
antennas, power), so a manpack on a ridge or a vehicle rack in the valley
extends the net the way a real repeater would. Direct is preferred whenever it
is the stronger link, and with no relay in reach the result is exactly ACRE's.

* **Off by default.** The *Enable mesh relaying* server setting turns it on;
  off, the result is ACRE's own point-to-point signal, still scaled by jamming.
* **Relays** are the manpacks and vehicle racks - PRC-152 and PRC-117F by
  default - carried by players or racked in vehicles. The PRC-148 squad
  handheld is an end point, never a relay. Same side only.
* **Hops** are unbounded; the route taken is the one whose weakest leg is
  strongest (a widest-path search over the relays in reach).
* **Loss**: a relay transmitting under the power threshold (1 W by default)
  costs a fraction of audio quality per hop; a relay at or above it repeats
  cleanly. Reception itself is never penalised by a hop.
* **Jamming** still applies on top - this addon took over the one custom
  signal function ACRE allows from `ghost_jamming` and applies its jam level
  itself.

Settings under *Ghosts of Battle > Radio Mesh*: enable (off by default), relay radio classes,
loss per weak hop, the power threshold, the relay-table refresh, and the cap
on relays examined per transmission.

## Requires

- `ghost_main`
