/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * ACRE's custom signal function: the signal a receiver gets from a
 * transmitter, routed through the mesh when that is stronger than the direct
 * path.
 *
 * ACRE calls this once per transmitter/receiver pair with the frequency, the
 * transmitter's power and the two radio ids, and expects [quality 0..1, dBm]
 * back. The direct result is ACRE's own (getSignalCore). Relays are the
 * friendly radios in the relay table on the same frequency; each leg is
 * ACRE's model too (fnc_edge). The path is the widest one - the route whose
 * weakest leg is strongest - found by a Dijkstra over the relays, unbounded in
 * hops. Quality is the weakest leg's, less the hop loss for every relay that
 * transmits under the power threshold. Reception (dBm) is the weakest leg's,
 * unpenalised. Whichever of direct and relayed hears better is returned.
 *
 * The jam level ghost_jamming maintains for this client is applied last, the
 * way that addon applied it before this one took the signal function over.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Frequency in MHz <NUMBER>
 * 1: Transmitter power in mW <NUMBER>
 * 2: Receiving radio id <STRING>
 * 3: Transmitting radio id <STRING>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * [quality 0..1, signal dBm] <ARRAY>
 *
 * Public: No (registered with acre_api_fnc_setCustomSignalFunc)
