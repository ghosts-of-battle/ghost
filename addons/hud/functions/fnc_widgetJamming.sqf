/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * JAMMING: which of the three services is down, and how hard.
 *
 * ONE ROW PER DOMAIN - RADIO, DATA, GPS (user, 2026-08-31). This was one big
 * percentage and one bar, which stopped meaning anything the moment a terminal
 * could take the voice net without touching TAC//MSG: the player read 60% and
 * could not tell what they had lost. All three are always drawn, so "what still
 * works" is one glance rather than three experiments.
 *
 * The numbers come off FUNC(sweep) - one read for the whole HUD - at the
 * indices EFUNC(hacking,scannerRead) appends them to, so this cannot disagree
 * with the tacpad JAM app or with what the radios are actually doing.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: The slot control <CONTROL>
 * 1: Y to start at <NUMBER>
 * 2: Slot width <NUMBER>
 * 3: Slot height <NUMBER>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * None
 *
 * Public: No
