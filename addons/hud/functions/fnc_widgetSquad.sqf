/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * SQUAD: one line when the section is whole, and the casualty list the moment it
 * is not.
 *
 * QUIET UNTIL IT MATTERS. A permanent roster of eight names is eight lines of
 * screen spent telling you what you already know - and by being there always, it
 * stops being read. ALL OK is one line, and the list appearing IS the alert.
 *
 * IT ASKS ACE, NOT THE ENGINE. `damage` on a man under ACE medical is not what
 * anybody means by wounded; unconscious, bleeding and the pain state are, and
 * they are ACE's to answer. Without ACE it falls back to damage, which is the
 * honest reading of a mission not running it.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: The slot control <CONTROL>
 * 1: Y to start at <NUMBER>
 * 2: Slot width <NUMBER>
 * 3: Slot height <NUMBER>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * None
 *
 * Public: No
