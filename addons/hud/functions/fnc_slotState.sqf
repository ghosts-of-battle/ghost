 * What a slot can show, and what it is showing.
 *
 * THE LIST IS THE SAME FOR BOTH SLOTS, and OFF is on it. That is the vanilla
 * info panel's own arrangement: cycling is a ring that includes showing nothing,
 * so a player turns a slot off by pressing past the end rather than by hunting
 * for a setting. Both slots offering everything means a left-hander and a
 * right-hander can each have what they want where they want it.
 *
 * A readout whose addon is not loaded stays on the ring and draws its own
 * absence - the suite is assembled from whatever a mission has, and a hole in
 * the ring would renumber every slot the first time a mod was dropped.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Slot - HUD_SLOT_LEFT or HUD_SLOT_RIGHT <NUMBER>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * 0: The ring, [id, label, drawer] each <ARRAY>
 * 1: Index of what this slot is showing <NUMBER>
 *
 * Example:
 * ([HUD_SLOT_LEFT] call ghost_hud_fnc_slotState) params ["_ring", "_i"]
 *
 * Public: No
