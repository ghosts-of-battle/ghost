 * Author: Ghost
 * SCANNER: the sweep, on the HUD.
 *
 * THREE READINGS, AND THAT IS THE SCANNER. The handset's screen carries more
 * than this - the net block, the armed alarm, the stopwatch, the STAND BY footer
 * - and an earlier version of this tile reproduced all twelve rows of it. That
 * is the DEVICE, not the scanner: the scanner is the sweep, and the sweep is UAV,
 * JAM and MESH. The rest of the handset's screen belongs to the radio tile and
 * the timer tile, which already carry it, and putting it here as well would be
 * the same numbers in two places waiting to disagree.
 *
 * The heading is the tile's, drawn by FUNC(draw) above its rule like every other
 * tile's - so the box reads SCANNER / UAV / JAM / MESH without the word being
 * printed twice.
 *
 * IT IS STILL THE DEVICE'S OWN LOOK. Same words (CLEAR, ALONE), same green
 * terminal, same rule about what turns amber and what turns red - UAV amber
 * inside 2 km and red inside 1, JAM amber partial and red smothered, MESH red
 * when you are on your own. A man who has carried the handset reads this without
 * being told it is the same thing.
 *
 * NOTHING IS MEASURED HERE. Every value is FUNC(sweep)'s, which is
 * EFUNC(hacking,scannerRead)'s cache - the same sweep the handset and the map
 * screens read, so no two surfaces can disagree about what is in the air.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: The slot control <CONTROL>
 * 1: Y to start at <NUMBER>
 * 2: Slot width <NUMBER>
 * 3: Slot height <NUMBER>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * None
 *
 * Public: No
