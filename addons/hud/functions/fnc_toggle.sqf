/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * Turns a slot off, or back on to whatever it was last showing.
 *
 * IT REMEMBERS, WHICH IS THE WHOLE DIFFERENCE FROM CYCLING. Off is on the cycle
 * ring - see FUNC(slotState) - so a player CAN reach it by stepping past the
 * end, but then getting back to the squad list means stepping through the other
 * two. A toggle that dropped you at the front of the ring would be a toggle
 * nobody used twice.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Slot - HUD_SLOT_LEFT or HUD_SLOT_RIGHT <NUMBER>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * None
 *
 * Example:
 * [HUD_SLOT_LEFT] call ghost_hud_fnc_toggle
 *
 * Public: Yes
