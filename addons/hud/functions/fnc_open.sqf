// A HUD belongs to a man in a world. With no player there is nothing to
// report on and nothing to report to.
//
// IT WAITS RATHER THAN GIVING UP, because a refusal that never retries is
// a mission with no HUD at all - and that is exactly what happened when the
// slots moved onto the mission display: CBA_settingsInitialized fires while
// the mission is still coming up, display 46 did not exist yet, and this
// gave up for good. The HUD never got built and Shift + [ did nothing,
// because the keybinds only redraw - they do not raise it.
//
// BOTH CONDITIONS, because either one missing means there is nothing to
// build or nothing to build it on. Whoever asked first is the only one who
// waits - the guard on the stored display above stops a queue forming.
