// THE HUD LAYER, AND THE TWO BOXES THE LAYOUT EDITOR MOVES.
//
// POSITION IS THE GAME'S JOB, NOT OURS. Ghost had its own move-and-save for
// overlays - ghost_common_fnc_hudPos and friends - and it never worked: it
// meant learning a ghost-specific way to move a ghost-specific widget, and it
// knew nothing about the panels the player had already arranged. Options > Game
// > Layout is where every other overlay in the game is placed, so it is where
// these are placed.
//
// THE REGISTRY IS CfgUIGrids, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE FIX. Two earlier attempts
// wrote grids into `CfgUIColors >> IGUI >> Grids` - which is where the BASE GAME
// keeps the positions of its own furniture, and reading it is what made that
// look right. It is not what the Layout editor enumerates. A mod's grid goes in
// `CfgUIGrids >> IGUI`, in two halves:
//
//   Presets > Arma3 > Variables    the DEFAULT geometry, as an array
//   Variables > <name>             the entry the editor LISTS, with its label,
//                                  what may be moved, and whether it resizes
//
// ACE's Micro DAGR is exactly this and is placed the same way; that is the
// working example this was rebuilt from.
//
// THE PROFILE VARIABLE NAMES FOLLOW THE CLASS NAME EXACTLY, case included:
// class grid_ghost_hudLeft gives IGUI_grid_ghost_hudLeft_X / _Y / _W / _H. They
// are NOT the IGUI_GRID_<SHOUTED>_X form the base game's own grids use - that
// was the other half of why nothing moved.
//
// saveToProfile[] = {0,1,2,3} is x, y, w and h: these may be moved AND
// resized, because a squad list wants to be tall and a jamming bar wants to be
// short, and only the player knows which they are looking at.
//
// TEN CELLS BY TEN, WHICH IS THE VANILLA CUSTOM INFO PANEL, EXACTLY. Read it
// off the game's own header - include/a3/ui_f/hpp/defineCommonGrids.inc, which
// is in this repo:
//
//   IGUI_GRID_CUSTOMINFO_WDef       (10 * GUI_GRID_W)
//   IGUI_GRID_CUSTOMINFO_HDef       (10 * GUI_GRID_H)
//   IGUI_GRID_CUSTOMINFOLEFT_XDef   (safeZoneX + 0.5 * GUI_GRID_W)
//   IGUI_GRID_CUSTOMINFOLEFT_YDef   (safeZoneY + safeZoneH - 21 * GUI_GRID_H)
//   IGUI_GRID_CUSTOMINFORIGHT_XDef  ((safeZoneX + safeZoneW) - (10.5 * GUI_GRID_W))
//   IGUI_GRID_CUSTOMINFORIGHT_YDef  (safeZoneY + safeZoneH - 21 * GUI_GRID_H)
//
// and HUD_CELL_W / HUD_CELL_H below ARE GUI_GRID_W and GUI_GRID_H, spelled out.
//
// THE HEIGHT WAS TWENTY, WHICH IS TWICE THE PANEL. The 21 in the vanilla Y is
// where the panel's TOP EDGE sits - 21 cells up from the bottom of a grid that
// is 25 cells tall - and not its height; the height is its own define and it
// is ten. Read as a height it made a box covering four fifths of the screen,
// and it dragged the left slot's Y out to 42 cells to clear a vanilla box it
// had put at the bottom of the screen: 42 cells up a 25-cell grid is off the
// top of it, which is where the left slot's default has been.
//
// BOTH SLOTS NOW SIT WHERE THE GAME PUTS ITS OWN INFO PANELS, AT THEIR SIZE -
// left and right, mid-height against the screen edge. That is also the one
// place on the screen the base game has already reserved for a readout of
// exactly this kind. A player who runs a vanilla panel in the same slot - a
// GPS minimap on the left, vehicle sensors on the right - moves one of the two
// in Options > Game > Layout, which is what that screen is for.
//
// The defaults below are macros ONLY where they are array elements. The control
// positions underneath are written out in full: a config value cannot be built
// by putting two strings next to each other, which is a thing this mod has been
// caught by before.

// NOT AN RscTitles LAYER. THIS IS THE WHOLE MAIN-MENU FIX.
//
// The HUD used to be a title layer raised with cutRsc and a duration of 1e11.
// A named title layer is NOT cleared by leaving a mission, so the left slot -
// showing the SCANNER readout - stayed on screen over the Arma 3 main menu,
// where it could not be clicked and would not go away. It was chased for eight
// builds with menu-side teardowns, and none of them could work: on the menu
// both the stored handle and findDisplay come back null, the main menu display
// is REUSED rather than created so it raises no event to hook, and a title
// layer's duration does not count down outside a mission so it can never lapse.
//
// So the layer is gone. Both slots are now plain controls created on the
// MISSION DISPLAY (findDisplay 46) - see FUNC(open). That display is created
// with the mission and destroyed with it by the engine, which means the HUD
// cannot reach the main menu whatever route the player takes out - abort,
// mission end, kick, or dropped server. It is a guarantee rather than a hook
// that has to fire.
//
// They are root-level classes because that is where ctrlCreate looks them up.
//
// NOTHING IS DECLARED INSIDE THEM. Both slots are filled at runtime with the
// tacpad's own drawFill/drawFrame/drawText, so the HUD and the map screens
// cannot drift apart in type, rule weight or colour - there is one design in
// this mod and one implementation of it.
//
// The four numbers come straight off the grid, so a slot moved or resized in
// the Layout editor IS the box the readout is drawn in - FUNC(draw) measures
// the control rather than assuming a size.
