// How long the title layer lives before the engine drops it, and how often

// nothing - which is what keeps the HUD off the main menu.
// Kept SHORT deliberately. At twenty seconds the panel could still be on
// the main menu for twenty seconds after leaving a mission, which looks
// exactly like the bug it is meant to end. Five gives the one-second tick
// four chances to renew - enough slack for a stutter - and puts the panel
// out within five seconds of the mission stopping.
