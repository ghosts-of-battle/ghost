#include "script_component.hpp"
/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * One kamikaze run: a real drone appears a few hundred metres out, flies a
 * straight dive at the building and detonates on arrival.
 *
 * REAL AND KILLABLE, which is the whole point of doing this with an
 * aircraft instead of a spawned explosion: it is heard coming, it can be
 * seen against the sky, and anything that shoots it down has genuinely
 * stopped the strike - a dead drone detonates nothing. Steering is a
 * velocity write per tick, the missile treatment - the UAV's own AI never
 * gets a vote on where it is going.
 *
 * The spawn point is gated like every module spawn: re-rolled until it is
 * inside the module's markers, and the run is skipped when no bearing is -
 * the war stays inside the line even while approaching from outside would
 * be prettier.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Building position ATL <ARRAY>
 * 1: Drone classname <STRING>
 * 2: Speed in m/s <NUMBER>
 * 3: The module's markers, for the spawn gate <ARRAY>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * The run is airborne <BOOL>
 *
 * Public: No
