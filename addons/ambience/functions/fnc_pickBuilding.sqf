#include "script_component.hpp"
/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * One building near one player, for the ambience to hit. Shared by the
 * shelling and the kamikaze modules - the "war happens around you" rule is
 * the same for both: a random player standing inside the markers, a random
 * building in the distance band around them, never the players themselves.
 *
 * Every candidate runs through EFUNC(common,taorGate) against the module's
 * own markers, the way every module spawn is gated now - a band that pokes
 * out of the marker never puts the war outside it.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Marker names, [] for anywhere <ARRAY>
 * 1: Band minimum in metres - the safety margin <NUMBER>
 * 2: Band maximum in metres <NUMBER>
 * 3: Caller tag for the gate's log <STRING>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * Building position ATL, [] when there is nothing to hit <ARRAY>
 *
 * Public: No
