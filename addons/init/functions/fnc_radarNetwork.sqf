/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * Put the listed vehicle classes on their side's sensor network.
 *
 * A SETTING, NOT A MISSION FILE (user, 2026-09-09: "Radar network needs to be
 * a cba setting"). This used to be twenty lines in every mission's
 * initServer.sqf reading config\config_radar.hpp, so adding a radar to the
 * network was a mission repack. It is a CBA setting now - and the mission class
 * and the database list are still read and added to it, so nothing that worked
 * before stops working.
 *
 * TWO SOURCES, ADDED TOGETHER, neither required:
 *   the setting     ghost_Settings_radarClasses - what a person types in the
 *                   settings menu, comma or newline separated
 *   the mission     missionConfigFile >> Radar_Network >> classes
 *
 * NOT THE DATABASE (user, 2026-09-09: "Radar network ... this is a cba
 * settings, make it a fucking cba settings, it should not be in pac"). It read
 * <unit>.radar as a third source, which meant the answer to "why is that thing
 * on the datalink" was in three places. The setting is the place.
 *
 * A CLASS EVENT HANDLER, not a sweep of `vehicles`: every vehicle of a listed
 * class joins the moment it exists, including the ones ALiVE spawns an hour in.
 * Applied to what is already placed as well - that is what the `true` at the
 * end of addClassEventHandler does.
 *
 * setDatalink switches reporting and receiving on; the radar itself is the one
 * flag it does not touch, so this sets it.
 *
 * Server only: a datalink is a shared picture, and every client doing this
 * would be the same work fifty times.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * None
 *
 * Return Value:
 * How many classes were wired <NUMBER>
 *
 * Public: No
