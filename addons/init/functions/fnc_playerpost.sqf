// THE WAIT LIVES HERE, NOT IN THE TWO FUNCTIONS. Both need a real `player`,
// and this runs from XEH postInit - an UNSCHEDULED context, where waitUntil
// does not wait, it throws. Each function used to open with its own
// waitUntil; each threw "Suspending not allowed in this context", each had
// its wait abandoned, and each then ran anyway against a null player. The
// proof was in every RPT, one line below the error:
//
//     [ghost] (initDiary) INFO: Applying Diary Records to <NULL-object>
//
// CBA's waitUntilAndExecute does the same wait from a per-frame handler,
// which needs no suspension - the pattern this file already uses for ACRE
// and TFAR below. `profileName` is folded in because FUNC(diary) wanted it
// too. A dedicated server never has a player, so hasInterface skips both
// outright rather than parking a handler that can never fire.
