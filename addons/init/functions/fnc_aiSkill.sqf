#include "script_component.hpp"
/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * The skill one AI gets, from the settings.
 *
 * THIS REPLACES config\config_skill.hpp (2026-09-09). That was a block of SQF
 * the mission compiled and handed over, so changing how hard the AI shoot meant
 * editing a file, repacking the mission and restarting the server. Every number
 * it set is a CBA setting now - see aiSkillSettings.inc.sqf - and the whole
 * thing is edited in the settings menu by whoever is running the night.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES, in the order it does it:
 *   1. the nine base skills, on every AI
 *   2. after dark, spotting is cut - hard when the AI has no night vision,
 *      which is the single thing that decides whether a night op feels fair
 *   3. machinegunners and snipers get their own aim, if that is switched on
 *
 * A MISSION THAT STILL SHIPS A SKILL BLOCK WINS. ghostFR_missionConfig_skillBlock
 * is called instead when it exists, so a mission carrying its own file behaves
 * exactly as it did - this is the answer for every mission that does not.
 *
 * CALLED ONCE PER AI, and an ALiVE session creates them in four figures - 1618
 * in a 21-minute session, in bursts of ~370 a minute. So: no logging, no config
 * lookups beyond the one this cannot avoid, and every setting read straight
 * from its variable.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: The unit <OBJECT>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * Nothing
 *
 * Public: No
