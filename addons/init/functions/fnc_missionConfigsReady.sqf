/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * THE MISSION HAS HANDED ITS CONFIGS OVER - build the databases from them.
 *
 * THIS EXISTS BECAUSE OF THE ORDER CBA RUNS THINGS IN. Extended_PreInit
 * handlers from addons (configFile) run BEFORE the ones from the mission
 * (missionConfigFile), so this addon's own preInit is always too early: it asks
 * for ghostFR_missionConfig_* before the mission's config\loadConfigs.sqf has set
 * them. Building at preInit alone would give every mission an empty logistics
 * database and no pylons, silently.
 *
 * So the mission calls this the moment its data is ready, and preInit calls it
 * too. Whichever happens first does the work; the second finds it already done.
 * A mission that hands nothing over gets empty databases and says so once,
 * which is the right answer for a mission that carries no catalogues.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * None
 *
 * Return Value:
 * The databases were built from real data <BOOL>
 *
 * Example:
 * call ghost_init_fnc_missionConfigsReady
 *
 * Public: Yes
