 * This function print messages on player connect.
 *
 * THE WAIT FOR `player` IS THE CALLER'S. This used to open with
 * `waitUntil {!isNull player && player == player}`, and FUNC(playerpost)
 * `call`s it from XEH postInit - which is UNSCHEDULED. waitUntil cannot
 * suspend there, so it threw "Suspending not allowed in this context",
 * the statement was abandoned, and the rest of the function ran anyway
 * against a null player. FUNC(playerpost) now does the waiting where CBA
 * can do it without suspending; see the note there.
 *
 * Example:
 * call ghost_init_fnc_message
 *
 * Public: No
