// The panel is JohnnyShootos' work, edited by TheTimidShade, taken from the
// mission framework it shipped in - which carries the GNU General Public
// License v3. That licence travels with the code: it cannot be relicensed as
// APL-SA, so it is not mixed into any other ghost addon. It is its own PBO,
// with its own LICENSE beside it, distributed alongside ghost rather than
// dissolved into it.
