#include "script_component.hpp"
/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * Paints and sizes the console from the player's tacpad settings.
 *
 * WHY A FUNCTION AND NOT CONFIG. The colours in ui\dialog.inc.hpp are the dark
 * scheme, written once so the display never flashes a wrong colour on the way
 * up. Everything a player can actually change - which of the seven schemes, how
 * solid the ground is, how big the whole thing should be - lives in the tacpad's
 * CBA settings, and a config file cannot read those. So the display opens, and
 * the first thing it does is repaint itself in whatever the player picked.
 *
 * THE SCALE IS APPLIED ABOUT THE CENTRE OF THE SCREEN. A console shrunk from the
 * top-left corner drifts off toward it; shrunk about the middle it stays a
 * console, just smaller, with a margin round it. Type is scaled with the boxes -
 * a smaller console with the same size text is a cramped console, not a small
 * one.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * None
 *
 * Return Value:
 * None
 *
 * Example:
 * [] call ghost_adminpanel_fnc_style
 *
 * Public: No
