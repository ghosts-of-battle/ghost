/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * What the map should be putting trackers on, for the tab that is selected.
 *
 * ONE PLACE, because admp_fnc_updateMapMarkers walks this list to CREATE the
 * markers and then walks its own array to UPDATE them - if the two disagreed
 * about what is being tracked the map would keep markers for things it no longer
 * shows.
 *
 * The lists are deliberately bounded. Every AI on a populated mission is a
 * thousand local markers redrawn ten times a second, so AI is the units nearest
 * the camera's own view of the map rather than all of them, and vehicles are the
 * ones with somebody in them or with damage worth looking at.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * None
 *
 * Return Value:
 * Objects to track <ARRAY>
 *
 * Example:
 * private _targets = [] call ghost_adminpanel_fnc_mapTargets
 *
 * Public: No
