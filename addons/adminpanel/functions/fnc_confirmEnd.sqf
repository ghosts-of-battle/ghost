/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * END MISSION, armed on the first press and fired on the second.
 *
 * THE ONE BUTTON ON THIS SCREEN THAT ENDS EVERYBODY'S EVENING. The mission panel
 * had this block commented out entirely - its button shared an idc with HEAL ALL
 * - so nobody has pressed it in anger yet, which makes now the time to decide how
 * hard it should be to press by accident.
 *
 * Two stages, which is what the design's CONFIRM x2 means: the first press arms
 * the button and it says so, and the second inside ten seconds hands off to the
 * panel's own admp_fnc_endMission - which puts up its own are-you-sure naming
 * the ending. Walk away and it disarms itself.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * None
 *
 * Return Value:
 * None
 *
 * Example:
 * [] call ghost_adminpanel_fnc_confirmEnd
 *
 * Public: No
