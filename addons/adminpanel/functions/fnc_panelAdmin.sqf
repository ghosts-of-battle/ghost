/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * The ADMIN button, between SETTINGS and HIDE ALL on the map screen.
 *
 * IT IS ONLY THERE FOR ADMINS. Not disabled for everyone else - absent. The
 * panel is registered with a condition on FUNC(isAdmin) (see XEH_preInit), which
 * the shell checks every time the map opens, so a player who is not on the
 * mission's list never sees a button whose only possible answer to them is no.
 * A grant mid-mission takes effect the next time they open the map.
 *
 * WHY A BUTTON AND NOT ONLY A KEYBIND. Pause/Break opens the console and always
 * has, and the people who use it every session know that. Everyone else does not
 * read keybind lists - the reason the tacpad puts its settings under the reader
 * rather than in Options is the same reason this is on the map: the screen you
 * are looking at when you decide you need it.
 *
 * NO TITLE BAR. Registered chromeless, like the two strips either side of it, so
 * the three read as one row of buttons rather than three little windows.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Body <CONTROL>
 * 1: Panel id <STRING>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * None
 *
 * Public: No
