/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * Puts a line in the RETURN panel beside the code box.
 *
 * THIS IS THE HALF THE DEBUG CONSOLE WAS MISSING. Code went out and a
 * notification said it had been sent; what it returned, and whether it threw,
 * went nowhere. An admin running `count allUnits` on the server had no way to
 * see the number.
 *
 * Called locally by the code box, and remotely by admp_fnc_compileAndExec on
 * whichever machine actually ran the code - which is why it is public.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: The line <STRING>
 * 1: Is it an error <BOOL> (optional, default false)
 *
 * Return Value:
 * None
 *
 * Example:
 * ["server exec ok"] call ghost_adminpanel_fnc_execLog
 *
 * Public: Yes
