/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * Opens the console, or says why it will not.
 *
 * THE GATE IS SAID OUT LOUD. The panel used to open for anybody and then close
 * itself again from inside fn_displayOpened, which reads as the screen flashing
 * and breaking rather than as a refusal. A man who is not on the list is told he
 * is not on the list.
 *
 * The message box is not gated and never was: it is how a player reaches an
 * admin, so gating it would defeat its only purpose.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Open the message box instead of the console <BOOL> (optional, default false)
 *
 * Return Value:
 * Opened <BOOL>
 *
 * Example:
 * [] call ghost_adminpanel_fnc_open
 *
 * Public: Yes
