/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * Narrows the player list to what was typed in the box above it.
 *
 * The filter is a plain substring, case-insensitive, matched against the name -
 * which is what everybody means by a search box and is faster than any cleverer
 * rule when the list is thirty names long.
 *
 * IT REBUILDS THROUGH THE PANEL'S OWN FUNCTION rather than hiding rows. The list
 * carries an index into admp_playerlist_playerArray in each row's VALUE, and
 * every action on this screen resolves its target through that index - so a list
 * filtered by any means other than a rebuild would point at the wrong man.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * None
 *
 * Return Value:
 * None
 *
 * Example:
 * [] call ghost_adminpanel_fnc_filterList
 *
 * Public: No
