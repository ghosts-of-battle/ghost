// ONE GATE, AND IT IS GHOST'S. This took a unit and then tested `player` - the
// LOCAL one - so every name in the list was marked with the admin's own status
// and every row got a star as soon as one admin opened the console.
//
// It delegates now rather than being fixed in place, because there were two
// answers to "is this man an admin" in this addon and they could disagree.
