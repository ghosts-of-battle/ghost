Function: ghost_repair_fnc_respawnOne

Description:
    Rebuilds one destroyed charge from the snapshot taken at mission start.

    The wreck is removed first. Creating the replacement on top of a wreck leaves
    two objects fighting for the same ground, and Arma resolves that by throwing
    one of them into the air.

    What comes back is a NEW object. It has the class, the place and the facing
    of the original, and a crew if the original had one - but not its name, its
    variables, its loadout edits, or any event handlers a mission script attached
    to it. Anything that has to survive a respawn belongs on the module or in a
    script keyed to position, not on the object.

Parameters:
    _record : ARRAY   - the charge's record.
    _cfg    : HASHMAP - the module's settings.

Returns:
    OBJECT - the replacement, objNull on failure.
