#include "script_component.hpp"
/*
 * Author: YonV
 * Repaints the teleport menu in the TAC//PAC colour scheme.
 *
 * THE DIALOG IS CONFIG AND THE SCHEME IS A RUNTIME SETTING, which is the whole
 * problem: `gui.hpp` can only state one set of colours, and the scheme the
 * player picked lives in a CBA setting that config cannot read. So the colours
 * in `gui.hpp` are a fallback and this repaints over them once the display
 * exists. The title bar was Ghost red on every scheme - the one thing anybody
 * notices - and the buttons were flat black.
 *
 * TACPAD IS NOT A DEPENDENCY and must not become one for a colour: `teleport`
 * requires `ghostD_main`, `ghostD_notify` and CBA, and a server running it
 * without the tablet suite is a server this must still open on. With no
 * `ghost_tacpad_fnc_theme` the config colours simply stand.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: The dialog's display <DISPLAY>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * Whether the scheme was applied <BOOL>
 *
 * Public: No
