# HIMF

`ghost_faction_himf`

The Horizon Islands Defence Force, rebuilt on the base game by
`tools/gen_himf.py` after Atlas left the load order: NATO Pacific bodies with
Tanoan identities, vehicles matched by job, the old HIMF's twenty groups role
for role.

hats, seven Modular Carrier rigs. Nothing is vendored and no class of ours sits
in the chain, which is the difference between this and everything that came
before it: the kit is a mod's, not a texture set built into ours.

**What is still ours.** The rucksacks, facewear and the whole French CE
wardrobe are still built and still in the arsenal - `UNIFORMS`, `HEADGEAR`,
`VESTS`, `BACKPACKS` and `FACEWEAR` in the generator, on `data/`'s vendored
those are unchanged and the men still carry them.

The previous state - HIMF dressed head to toe in French CE - is preserved at
`backup/himf_frce_2026-08-29/`, with instructions for putting it back.

**Also HIMF's own**, none of it borrowed: the faction and group lists, the
Tanoan identities and flag, the vehicle roster and its crewing, the drone bags,
and the XMS rifle presets and the marksman's Mk-I EMR in `CfgWeapons.hpp`.

**On Atlas's own HIMF since 2026-08-29** (user: "himf move back to the uniforms
in the aegis himf - uniforms and weapons"). Every man inherits from the matching
`Atlas_B_H_*` class - uniform, vest, helmet, rifle (M16A4 on the line, XMS on
the commandos) and pack are Atlas's by link, nothing copied. Ours on top: the
Tanoan identity, the FA tier-2 round wherever the index knows the magazine, the
squad drones, and the vehicles already settled: the EMB 312 mod's AT-27M35
Tucano in grey and Atlas's HIMF Caesar BTT as the only planes (user, 2026-08-29),
the Hummingbird, Pawnee, RF Hellcat and Atlas's own HIMF EC-04 / EC-03
helicopters (the EUDF Wildcats went with EUDF35), RF Ram 1500s, EF Gyras, and
no APC beyond EF's two Gyras (Atlas's Otokar ARMAs
came out on 2026-08-30 at the user's request).
Atlas's characters addon is a real dependency; without it the PBO is skipped.
