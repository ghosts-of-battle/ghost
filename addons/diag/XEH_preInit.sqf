// CBA's preStart dispatch runs inside `with uiNamespace do` - the mission
// namespace does not exist that early - and CBA_fnc_compileFunction stores each
// function in uiNamespace, then copies it into missionNamespace. That copy is
// thrown away when a mission loads. An addon that PREPs ONLY at preStart
// therefore has NO functions once a mission is running.
//
// That was the whole reason every function in these eleven addons came back
// "Undefined variable" in game while the config, the packing and the handlers
// were all provably correct. 73 of ghost's other 79 addons already do this;
// these were the exception because they were written from scratch in one go.
