/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * The player's squad tag, from their squad.xml, or "" if they have none.
 *
 * THIS WAS CALLED AND NEVER WRITTEN. FUNC(unit_getVariables) and
 * FUNC(unit_getName) both called ghost_players_fnc_getClanTag /
 * ghost_players_fnc_hasClanTag, which existed nowhere - so a name lookup threw
 * rather than returning a name. Written here against BI's own squad data.
 *
 * DEFENSIVE ON PURPOSE. squadParams returns nothing at all for a player with
 * no squad.xml, and the shape of what it does return is not worth trusting
 * blind - so anything unexpected reads as "no tag", and the callers fall back
 * to the untouched profile name. A wrong tag would silently mangle every
 * player's name; no tag simply leaves it alone.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Unit <OBJECT> (optional, default player)
 *
 * Return Value:
 * The squad tag <STRING>
 *
 * Example:
 * private _tag = call ghost_players_fnc_getClanTag;
 *
 * Public: Yes
