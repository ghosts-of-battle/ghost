#include "script_component.hpp"
/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * The net name of the platoon a squad belongs to, from the unit's ORBAT.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The MR plan is written per PLATOON, not per squad (user,
 * 2026-09-01: "4 plt nets ever one sees then squad net only a squad sees") -
 * four channels for a task force of fourteen elements. fn_getRadioChannel
 * matches a channel by name against the group id, so "NOMAD 2-3" finds nothing
 * and would land on the detachment default; this is what it asks next.
 *
 * THE ORBAT ALREADY SAYS WHICH SQUADS ARE IN WHICH PLATOON - the platoon rows
 * the role screen draws its tabs from - so a platoon that wants a radio net
 * adds one property to the tab it already has. Read through
 * ghost_groups_fnc_orbat, so the rows are the database's when TAC//PAC holds
 * the ORBAT there and the mission's Dynamic_Groups otherwise.
 *
 * ONE TABLE. The platoon a squad belongs to, and the net on that platoon.
 * There was a "shared radio nets" table asked first; it is gone, and so is
 * the idea (user, 2026-09-09: "noi fucking shared nets ... acre and tfar tab
 * only for fucking radios"). Radio channels are the ACRE and TFAR plans;
 * messaging nets are mailboxes on the messaging tab.
 *
 * A platoon with no net, a unit with no platoons, or a squad in no platoon all
 * answer "" and leave the caller on its default.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Squad name <STRING> - the group id, any case
 *
 * Return Value:
 * Net name, upper-cased, or "" <STRING>
 *
 * Example:
 * ["NOMAD 2-3"] call ghost_players_fnc_platoonNet  // "NOMAD"
 *
 * Public: No
