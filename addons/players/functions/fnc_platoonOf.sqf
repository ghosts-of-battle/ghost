/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * The ID of the platoon a squad belongs to, from the unit's ORBAT.
 *
 * WHY THIS AND NOT FUNC(platoonNet). That one answers with the platoon's
 * messaging NET, which is what the MR plan is written against. This answers
 * with the platoon's ID - the first element of the platoon row - because the
 * long-range plan is keyed by platoon, not by net: two platoons can share a
 * net and still want different LR channels, and a platoon can have an LR
 * channel and no net at all.
 *
 * Read through ghost_groups_fnc_orbat, so the rows are the database's when
 * TAC//PAC holds the ORBAT there and the mission's Dynamic_Groups otherwise.
 *
 * A unit with no platoons, or a squad in no platoon, answers "" and leaves the
 * caller on its default.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Squad name <STRING> - the group id, any case
 *
 * Return Value:
 * The platoon id as the ORBAT spells it, or "" <STRING>
 *
 * Example:
 * ["NOMAD 2-3"] call ghost_players_fnc_platoonOf  // "Plt2"
 *
 * Public: No
