// OFF BY DEFAULT, AND THAT IS THE POINT. Reading a squad tag means asking the
// engine for the player's squad, and the engine answers that by resolving the
// squad's logo as well - a file it caches under
// <profile>\Squads\<nick>\<hash>.paa and re-reads every frame it fails to load.
// The 2026-08-31 build put 19,870 "Cannot load texture ...squads\ghost\*.paa"
// lines in a 21-minute RPT, one per rendered frame, and every session before it
// had none. Nothing in the mission needs a squad tag badly enough to pay that,
// so the lookup only happens when somebody asks for it.
//
// Turning it on is safe wherever the squad.xml a player is using actually
// resolves; see the addon README.
