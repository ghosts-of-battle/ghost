/*
 * Author: Jacco Douma, Ghost
 * Where a group's marker goes this pass. Two independent stages: tracking says
 * where the group IS - the leader, or a weighted average pulled towards the rest
 * of the group - and trailing says how far behind that truth the marker is
 * allowed to lag, which is what makes a tracker feel like a radio report rather
 * than a live feed.
 *
 * Recent positions are kept on the group itself and never broadcast: each
 * machine builds the same history off the same leader positions, so the trail
 * costs nothing on the network.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Group <GROUP>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * Position <ARRAY>
 *
 * Example:
 * [group player] call ghost_bft_fnc_getGroupPosition
 *
 * Public: No
