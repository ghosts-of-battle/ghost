 * The CfgMarkers side letter a group's icon is built from. Automatic reads the
 * group's side; anything else forces one shape on every group there is, which is
 * why the setting warns about enemy markers.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Group <GROUP>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * Marker side letter, "b" / "o" / "n" <STRING>
 *
 * Example:
 * [group player] call ghost_bft_fnc_getGroupMarkerShape
 *
 * Public: No
