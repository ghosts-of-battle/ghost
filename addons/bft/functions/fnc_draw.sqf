/*
 * Author: Jacco Douma, Ghost
 * Draws one pass of group markers on this machine. Every marker is local and
 * every position is computed locally off the group's own units - what travels
 * the network is nothing but the handful of group variables a leader sets, so
 * the update rate costs no bandwidth at all.
 *
 * Who sees whom is a code match, not a side check. A group TRANSMITS on its
 * encrypt codes and LISTENS on its decrypt codes; a marker is drawn when one of
 * the viewer's codes appears in the target's transmit list. A group with no
 * codes at all falls back to its own side's name, which is what makes the
 * default behaviour "everyone on my side" without any setup.
 *
 * A logged-in admin bypasses the lot - see FUNC(isAdmin).
 *
 * Arguments:
 * None
 *
 * Return Value:
 * None
 *
 * Example:
 * [] call ghost_bft_fnc_draw
 *
 * Public: No
