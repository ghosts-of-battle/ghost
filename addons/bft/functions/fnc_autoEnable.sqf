/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * Switches the player's CURRENT group on, if nobody has said otherwise about it.
 *
 * THE TRACKER SWITCH IS A PROPERTY OF THE GROUP. That is right - a group is what
 * gets a marker - but it means the answer follows the group and not the man, so
 * every time a player moves into another group he arrives in one that has never
 * been switched on. His own marker disappears and the tracker looks broken when
 * it is doing exactly what it was told.
 *
 * ONLY WHEN NOBODY HAS DECIDED. A group whose visibility has been set - by a
 * mission init field, by its leader through the map menu, by an admin - keeps
 * that answer. This fills in the blank and nothing else.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * None
 *
 * Return Value:
 * None
 *
 * Example:
 * [] call ghost_bft_fnc_autoEnable
 *
 * Public: No
