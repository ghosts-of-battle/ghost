Function: ghost_antiship_fnc_tick

Description:
    Scheduler. When the interval elapses, finds a hull and puts a missile into it.

    ONE LAUNCHER, ONE CLOCK. This hung off the battery module's logic in ghost,
    which owned several launchers and one interval between them. There is no
    module: a hand-placed launcher carries its own config and its own clock, so
    the thing passed in here is the launcher itself.

    The clock is reset whether or not anything was found. A battery that keeps
    retrying every tick because the sea happens to be empty would fire the
    instant a ship appeared, which is not a coastal battery, it is a trap.

Parameters (CBA PFH): 0: [launcher], 1: handle
