Function: ghost_antiship_fnc_radarSweep

Description:
    One pass over every registered surface search radar: decide whether the set
    is radiating, and if it is, write down what it can see.

    Three things bound what a radar sees, and all three are the reason siting it
    matters:

      instrumented range - how far the set was built to look
      radar horizon      - 4.12 * (sqrt(antenna height) + sqrt(mast height)) km.
                           The sea curves away. An antenna 20 m up sees a
                           destroyer's mast about 30 km off; put the same set on
                           a 200 m headland and it sees 45. Height is range.
      line of sight      - a hull behind a headland is not there. This is what
                           lets a ship hug the coast and come in unseen, and
                           what makes one radar not enough to cover a bay.

    EMCON is the fourth: the set radiates for a while and is silent for a while,
    so it cannot simply be waited out, and so that a player with direction
    finding has something intermittent to chase rather than a permanent beacon.
    Contacts are NOT cleared while it is silent - they age out (AS_RADAR_TRACK),
    which is what gives a destroyed radar a last few seconds of usable track and
    then blindness.
