Function: ghost_antiship_fnc_launcherInit

Description:
    Brings one launcher on line. Placed in Eden, spawned by Zeus or dropped by a
    script - all the same, the same way the radar does it.

    THERE IS NO MODULE, AND THAT IS THE CHANGE. In ghost this addon was driven by
    ghost_moduleAntiShip: switch a side on and it SITED a battery for you, on
    coastal ground inside that side's ALiVE TAOR markers. DIVINER has no TAORs
    and no commanders to own them, so the siting had nowhere to read from - and
    the honest replacement is not a smaller module, it is putting the launcher
    where you want it. A mission maker knows which headland the battery is on.

    ONE LAUNCHER IS ONE BATTERY. The module grouped several under one clock; a
    hand-placed launcher owns its own, so three launchers on a headland are three
    tubes on three cycles rather than one battery firing three times as fast.
    That is the more predictable answer for somebody placing them by eye, and it
    means deleting one launcher removes exactly one tube.

    THE RADARS ARE SHARED AND READ LIVE. FUNC(pickTarget) is handed the whole
    registry each cycle rather than a list baked in here, so a radar placed after
    the launcher still sees for it - which is the ordinary case in Zeus, where
    the launcher goes down first because it is the thing being hidden.

    IT REGISTERS ITSELF AS A BATTERY. [id, position, side] into
    QGVAR(batteries), broadcast, because the hacking suite's LOCATE ANTI-SHIP
    product and its Intel Hunt pool both read that registry on the client. Keyed
    by grid rather than by netId: a battery is a PLACE to those products, and the
    id has to survive the object being replaced.

    AND AS AN ALiVE OBJECTIVE, when the adapter is loaded. The same id goes to
    EFUNC(adapter_alive,registerSite) so OPCOM garrisons and defends the thing
    it owns. Guarded - without ALiVE the launcher is exactly what it was.

Parameters:
    0: OBJECT - the launcher.

// the battery registry uses, so the objective and the battery are one thing

// names to anything reading both.
