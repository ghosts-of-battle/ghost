Function: ghost_antiship_fnc_radarInit

Description:
    Brings one surface search radar on the air.

    The radar exists because a coastal battery that can see the sea is a battery
    you find by looking at the sea. The launchers sit inland behind terrain with
    no line of sight to the water at all; this is the thing that looks, and the
    thing worth killing. Sync radars to the battery module the same way the
    launchers are synced - a battery with radars synced sees ONLY what they see,
    and a battery with none falls back to looking for itself.

    Registration only. The sweep itself is one server-side loop over every
    registered set (FUNC(radarSweep)) rather than a handler each: a coastline
    can carry a dozen of these and twelve timers to do one job is eleven too
    many.

Parameters:
    0: OBJECT - the radar.
