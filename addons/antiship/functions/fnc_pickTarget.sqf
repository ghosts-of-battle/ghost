Function: ghost_antiship_fnc_pickTarget

Description:
    Finds a hull worth a missile.

    Classes are matched by INHERITANCE rather than by exact name. The static
    carrier and destroyer are assembled from dozens of part classes that all
    descend from one base, and "Ship" covers every boat in the game - a list of
    exact names would miss most of a carrier and every mod's vessels.

    Nearest wins. A coastal battery shoots at what is closest to its coast.

Parameters:
    _cfg : HASHMAP - the battery's settings.

Returns:
    OBJECT - the hull, objNull if the sea is empty.
