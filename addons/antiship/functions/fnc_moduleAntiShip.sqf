Function: ghost_antiship_fnc_moduleAntiShip

Description:
    Sites the coastal anti-ship batteries so the mission maker does not have to -
    or get to - know where they are (user, 2026-10-03). The module ghost had,
    brought back: DIVINER dropped it because DIVINER has no TAORs, and the
    launcher's own doc still says so. Ghost runs ALiVE, which does.

    WHO GETS ONE. Every ALiVE commander whose side the players are not on, each
    inside its own TAOR (EFUNC(adapter_alive,taorFor)). No side field: the enemy
    is whoever the mission's commanders and player slots say it is (D59). With
    no ALiVE commanders the module's own area is the ground, for the first side
    the players are not on.

    WHAT A BATTERY IS. A surface search radar on the shoreline - the only part
    that can see the sea - and its launchers inland behind it, sited where they
    CANNOT see the water (the README's design: kill the radar and the battery is
    blind). Each piece brings itself on line through its own Extended_Init, the
    same as one placed by hand; this only finds the ground and crews it.

    NOT PROFILED, ON PURPOSE. Profiling virtualises - ALiVE deletes what it is
    handed and spawns it again near players - and a launcher's clock and a
    radar's tracks live on the object. EFUNC(adapter_alive,profileIgnore) is the
    documented opt-out, as air defence uses it. OPCOM still garrisons the site:
    the launcher registers it as an objective itself.

Parameters:
    0: The module logic <OBJECT>
    1: Synchronised units <ARRAY>
    2: Activated <BOOL>

Returns:
    None
