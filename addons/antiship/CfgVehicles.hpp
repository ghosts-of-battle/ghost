    // find clean shore line to place anti ship launcher and radar so the
    // mission maker does not know where they are"). DIVINER dropped it because
    // DIVINER has no TAORs; ghost runs ALiVE, which has them. Same class name,
    // so missions that already carry it load it again.
    //
    // NO SIDE ON IT. Every ALiVE commander the players are not on gets its
    // batteries, inside its own TAOR - who the enemy is comes from the mission,
    // not from a field (D59). Placing the module is the switch.
    //
    // OPERATION VALUES ONLY - how many. Where comes from ALiVE: the radar on the
    // coast where it sees the sea, the launchers inland where they cannot.

    // Ancestry restated so the turret override below has something real to
    // inherit (same pattern as the naval addon). Each link keeps its own
    // parent, and the chain stops at MainTurret without reaching inside it.
    //
    // This is a MERGE, not a replacement: a class body here annotates the
    // vanilla class rather than overwriting it, which is why restating the
    // chain is safe and why the override below has a base to name. Deleting it
    // and reaching for a parentless nested reopen instead severs the turret and
    // strips primaryGunner - that has been tried.
    //
    // DO NOT CHASE the "Duplicate HitPoint name 'HitGun'/'HitTurret'" warnings
    // to this file. VERIFIED, not assumed: a3\static_f_sams\sam_system_04
    // declares HitTurret at line 203 and HitGun at 207 under HitPoints, then
    // declares both again at 451 and 474 inside the turret - and adds a
    // differently-cased `Hitpoints: HitPoints` at 228 on top.
    //
    // The proof it is not ours is in any RPT that spawns statics: the same two
    // lines appear for the untouched vanilla O_T_SAM_System_04_F and
    // O_T_Radar_System_02_F, and for other mods' classes on the same chassis.
    // Ours is named only because ours is the leaf being spawned. It fires once
    // per class at first spawn, not per frame.
    //
    // Silencing it means restating BI's whole damage model on our leaf, which
    // is a real behaviour change to remove two cosmetic lines. Not worth it -
    // unlike the CM_ warnings below, which ARE ours to answer and now are.
    // StaticMGWeapon's Turrets is `Turrets: Turrets` in the game, so it is
    // restated with that parent (declared on StaticWeapon); a bare
    // `class Turrets {` rebinds it - RPT "Updating base class 'Turrets'->''".
