// WHAT THE MODULE'S ATTRIBUTES BECAME. ghost_moduleAntiShip carried twenty-two
// of them, most describing where to SITE a battery - the sides to enable, each
// side's TAOR markers, each side's launcher class, how many to place. None of
// that survives: there is no module and no TAOR, and a launcher stands where
// somebody put it.
//
// What is left is how a battery BEHAVES, which is the same for every battery on
// the map and therefore a setting rather than a per-object field. A mission that
// needs two batteries behaving differently has a bigger question than this
// addon answers.
//
// ALL SERVER-SIDE. Every one of these decides something that happens on the
// server and is seen by everybody - a client cannot be allowed its own opinion
// about how fast a missile flies.
