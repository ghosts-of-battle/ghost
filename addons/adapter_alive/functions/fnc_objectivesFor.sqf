 * Author: Ghost
 * A side's objectives, as its commander knows them.
 *
 * Keys verified against source (mil_opcom fnc_OPCOM.sqf:2907-2911): the type
 * key is "objectiveType", NOT "type" - reading "type" returns empty forever
 * and every consumer silently sees an untyped world.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Side <SIDE>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * [[id <STRING>, pos <ARRAY>, size <NUMBER>, type <STRING>], ...] <ARRAY>
 * type is ALiVE's own objectiveType text; consumers filter, this translates.
 *
 * Example:
 * [east] call ghost_adapter_alive_fnc_objectivesFor
