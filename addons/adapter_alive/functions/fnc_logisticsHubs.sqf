/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * Every logistics hub LOGCOM runs supply from, as a hunt pool.
 *
 * ALiVE's supply network is ALIVE_ML_supplyNetwork (mil_logistics
 * fnc_ML.sqf:3181-3206, 14077-14107): an ALiVE hash keyed by FACTION, each
 * value a list of nodes [position, [deliveredProfileIDs], isHQ?]. The HQ node
 * is seeded from the commander's module position; every completed delivery
 * adds its destination as a node, merged with any node within 500 m. That is
 * the whole of "where their supply comes from", and it is exactly what a raid
 * on the rear should be pointed at.
 *
 * LOGCOM's own validity rule is kept (fnc_ML.sqf:1311-1320): a node counts
 * while it is the HQ or while at least one thing it delivered is still alive
 * in the profile system. A hub whose every delivery is dead is a hub the
 * enemy has stopped using.
 *
 * Side comes from the faction (ALiVE_fnc_factionSide), which is what LOGCOM
 * keys on - never from what stands there.
 *
 * Arguments: None
 *
 * Return Value:
 * [[id <STRING>, pos <ARRAY>, side <SIDE>, isHQ <BOOL>], ...] <ARRAY>
 * id is "hub_" + faction + "_" + index in that faction's node list.
 *
 * Example:
 * call ghost_adapter_alive_fnc_logisticsHubs
 *
 * Public: Yes
