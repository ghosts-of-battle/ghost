 * Does ALiVE still know this profile id? The seam the uas patrol prune
 * needed: its keep-predicate for profiled patrols had decayed into a bare
 * function-existence check - a constant - so dead profiled patrols counted
 * against the ceiling forever. The adapter is the only addon allowed to
 * know ALiVE's names, so the actual lookup lives here.
 *
 * Answers TRUE when it cannot ask - an adapter that is not ready is no
 * reason to cull somebody's patrol.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Profile id <STRING>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * The profile still exists <BOOL>
 *
 * Public: No
