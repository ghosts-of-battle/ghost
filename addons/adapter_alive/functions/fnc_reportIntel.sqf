#include "script_component.hpp"
/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * Hands a piece of ghost intel to the friendly commander's G2, so the
 * C2ISTAR tablet, the COP and ALiVE's own confidence decay show what the
 * players earned through a hack or a deposit - one picture, not two.
 *
 * G2 is per OPCOM (mil_intelligence fnc_G2.sqf, created at mil_opcom
 * fnc_OPCOM.sqf:400 and stored on the handler under "G2"); it exists only
 * when the side's C2ISTAR has displayIntel on. No G2, nothing happens - the
 * ghost circle is still drawn by its own renderer.
 *
 * WHAT IS REPORTED IS WHAT THE CIRCLE SAYS. The position handed over is the
 * circle's centre, fuzzed by the ladder, never the true position - the G2
 * learns exactly as much as the player did.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Side that earned the intel <SIDE>
 * 1: Side the target belongs to <SIDE>
 * 2: Target id <STRING> - a profileID where there is one, any stable id otherwise
 * 3: Reported position <ARRAY>
 * 4: Kind <STRING> - ghost's label ("artillery", "air defence", "camp", ...)
 *
 * Return Value:
 * Reported <BOOL>
 *
 * Example:
 * [west, east, _profileID, _centre, "artillery"] call ghost_adapter_alive_fnc_reportIntel
 *
 * Public: No
