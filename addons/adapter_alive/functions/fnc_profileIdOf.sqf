 * what it is called - the seam is the point, and a one-line read is exactly
 * the kind of thing that quietly breaks it.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Profile entity <ARRAY>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * Profile id, "" if it has none <STRING>
 *
 * Example:
 * [_profile] call ghost_adapter_alive_fnc_profileIdOf
