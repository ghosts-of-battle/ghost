/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * Raises the civilian population's hostility toward a side, in the settlement
 * nearest a position.
 *
 * ALiVE'S CIVILIAN SYSTEM ALREADY KEEPS THIS LEDGER, per settlement cluster and
 * per side, and its own population reacts to it - which is the whole reason to
 * write into it rather than to keep a second opinion of our own. Ghost's job is
 * to say what happened and where; what a town does about it is ALiVE's.
 *
 * IT IS HERE BECAUSE OF THE SEAM. This was written inline in ghost_hacking,
 * naming ALIVE_clustersCivSettlement and ALiVE_fnc_hashGet/hashSet directly -
 * a second addon that could not survive ALiVE being absent, which is exactly
 * what the adapter exists to prevent. The caller now says "somebody saw this"
 * and does not know whether anyone is keeping score.
 *
 * SERVER ONLY, in the sense that it must run where the civilian system reads the
 * ledger. It does not check that itself - the caller's event does.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Position, 2D or 3D <ARRAY>
 * 1: Side, as ALiVE stores it - "WEST", "EAST", "GUER", "CIV" <STRING>
 * 2: How much to add, clamped to 100 <NUMBER>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * The settlement's new hostility toward that side, or -1 if nothing was
 * written - no ALiVE, no index for this map, or no cluster near enough <NUMBER>
 *
 * Example:
 * [getPosATL player, "WEST", 5] call ghost_adapter_alive_fnc_bumpHostility
 *
 * Public: No
