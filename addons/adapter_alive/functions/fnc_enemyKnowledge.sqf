 * Author: Ghost
 * What the enemy commanders currently know about a side's forces.
 *
 * Every OPCOM keeps "knownentities" - the spot reports its troops file -
 * and the COP broadcasts them as ALiVE_COP_IntelData_<SIDE> (mil_c2istar
 * cop fnc_COPServer.sqf:346): [pos, sideKey, type, factionCode, count,
 * sizeInd, activity, heading, speed, age, isMixed, trail]. Read for every
 * side hostile to the asking one, filtered to entries ABOUT the asking one,
 * this is "the enemy has your position" - the one thing a patrol most
 * wants to know before it is too late.
 *
 * Public variables, so this answers on any machine.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Side <SIDE> - whose forces are being asked about
 *
 * Return Value:
 * [[pos <ARRAY>, type <STRING>, count <NUMBER>, age <NUMBER>, bySide <STRING>], ...]
 *
 * Example:
 * [west] call ghost_adapter_alive_fnc_enemyKnowledge
 *
 * Public: Yes
