/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * Asks the side's LOGCOM to send something to a place - the "enemy rebuilds"
 * half of every ghost site. A cache that is hit gets a section to guard the
 * next one; a battery that is hit gets its defenders back.
 *
 * LOGCOM_REQUEST is what ALiVE's own ATO raises when it loses an airframe
 * (mil_ato fnc_ATO.sqf:4890): [position, faction, sideText, forceMakeup,
 * "STANDARD"]. forceMakeup is six counts - infantry, motorised, mechanised,
 * armour, plane, helicopter. What arrives is a convoy the players can
 * interdict, and now can find: LOCATE LOGISTICS points at where it starts.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Side <SIDE>
 * 1: Destination <ARRAY>
 * 2: Force makeup <ARRAY> - [inf, motorised, mechanised, armour, plane, heli]
 *    (optional, default one infantry group)
 *
 * Return Value:
 * Requested <BOOL>
 *
 * Example:
 * [east, _pos, [1,0,0,0,0,0]] call ghost_adapter_alive_fnc_requestSupply
 *
 * Public: No
