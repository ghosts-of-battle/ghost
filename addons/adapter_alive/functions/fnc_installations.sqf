/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * The asymmetric commander's installations - the physical network the intel
 * economy points at (new.md section 5).
 *
 * ALiVE does NOT record an installation as an objective of its own. It hangs
 * it off the objective it was built in, as one key per kind on that
 * objective's hash - "HQ", "factory", "depot", "roadblocks" - whose value is
 * the building serialised by OPCOM's convertObject: [[x, y], className], or
 * [] once it is gone. objectiveType never carries these names (it is the
 * placement label, MIL/CIV/CUS/CCU), so a filter on it answers empty forever.
 * Verified against mil_opcom fnc_OPCOM.sqf (createAsymmetricInstallation,
 * convertObject) and fnc_INS_helpers.sqf (the four HashSet sites).
 *
 * A conventional commander has none of these, so a map with no asymmetric
 * commander returns empty and every consumer stays quiet rather than
 * inventing targets.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Kinds wanted <ARRAY of STRING> (optional, default the design's four;
 *    "hq"/"factory"/"depot"/"roadblocks", any case)
 *
 * Return Value:
 * [[id <STRING>, pos <ARRAY>, size <NUMBER>, type <STRING>], ...] <ARRAY>
 * id is unique per installation (objectiveID_kind), pos is the building's
 * own position, size is the parent objective's, type is the lower-case kind.
 *
 * Example:
 * [] call ghost_adapter_alive_fnc_installations
