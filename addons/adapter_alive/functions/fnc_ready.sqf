 * Waits for ALiVE to finish standing up, then declares the adapter ready.
 *
 * Every read sits behind this. ALiVE populates OPCOM_instances and the
 * profile system asynchronously, and a read that races init returns nothing -
 * which a caller cannot tell apart from "there is nothing there". Readiness
 * is: the globals exist, at least one commander, and every commander
 * reporting startupComplete.
 *
 * Raises "ghost_adapter_ready" once.
 *
 * Arguments: None

 * Return Value: None
