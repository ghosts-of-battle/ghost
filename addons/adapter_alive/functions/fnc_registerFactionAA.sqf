 * Author: Ghost
 * Tells ALiVE what air defence THIS mod's factions field.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. mil_placement spawns AA from two sources: the mission
 * maker's own picker (the "AA Units" field), and - when that is left empty -
 * the ALIVE_factionDefaultAA hash. That hash ships with stock A3 factions
 * only, and ALiVE's own comment beside it is explicit: "Mod factions not
 * listed here yield no AA fallback". So every 2040 faction placed with an AA
 * count and an empty picker spawned NOTHING, silently, and the mission maker
 * had no way to know except by counting what appeared.
 *
 * WHAT COUNTS AS AA IS ALiVE'S OWN ANSWER - ALiVE_fnc_isAntiAirCapable, the
 * predicate its SEAD task uses (and FUNC(aaTargets) here): it asks what the
 * vehicle can SHOOT WITH rather than what its turret elevation is, so unarmed
 * high-mount hulls and radars fall out on their own. Reusing it means this
 * agrees with ALiVE about what air defence is, by construction.
 *
 * NOTHING ALREADY REGISTERED IS OVERWRITTEN. A faction ALiVE knows, or one a
 * mission has set up itself, keeps what it has; this only fills holes.
 *
 * TIMED OFF THE HASH, NOT OFF FUNC(ready). The fallback is read when a
 * placement module runs, which can be before OPCOM finishes standing up -
 * waiting for full adapter readiness would sometimes register too late to
 * matter. So it polls for the hash itself and writes the moment it exists.
 *
 * Arguments: None

 * Return Value: None
