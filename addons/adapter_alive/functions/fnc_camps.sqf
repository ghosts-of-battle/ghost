/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * Every camp ALiVE's military placement stood up, as a hunt pool.
 *
 * ALiVE has no camp registry. A random camp is a composition dropped on a
 * strategic cluster, and the only record it leaves is three keys written back
 * onto that cluster's hash at placement (mil_placement fnc_MP.sqf:1330-1332):
 * "campSafePos" (where it stands), "campEnvelope" (its footprint) and
 * "campSeats".
 *
 * NOT THE GLOBAL TABLE. The module COPIES its clusters before it works on
 * them (fnc_MP.sqf:788, ALIVE_fnc_copyClusters) and stores the copies on its
 * own logic as "objectives" and "objectivesLand" (fnc_MP.sqf:804, 844 -
 * OOsimpleOperation is a setVariable); the camp loop later writes onto those
 * same copies. ALIVE_clustersMil never learns of a camp. So this reads every
 * placement module's stored clusters, both lists (they share elements),
 * once per clusterID.
 *
 * WHOSE CAMP IS DERIVED, NOT STORED. The cluster does not know who garrisons
 * it, and a camp changes hands when the war moves. The side is whoever holds
 * the ground now: the majority side of the entity profiles within
 * CAMP_SIDE_RADIUS. An empty camp answers sideUnknown - a consumer that hunts
 * hostile camps must drop those, a tent with nobody in it is not a target.
 *
 * Arguments: None
 *
 * Return Value:
 * [[id <STRING>, pos <ARRAY>, size <NUMBER>, side <SIDE>], ...] <ARRAY>
 * id is "camp_" + clusterID, stable for the life of the mission.
 *
 * Example:
 * call ghost_adapter_alive_fnc_camps
 *
 * Public: Yes
