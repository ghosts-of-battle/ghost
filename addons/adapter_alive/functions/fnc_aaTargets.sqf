 * Author: Ghost
 * Every AA piece ALiVE is running, as a hunt pool (new.md section 1.1 -
 * ghost spawns none of this).
 *
 * TWO READS, ONE POOL. ALIVE_aaProfileBehaviour is what mil_placement
 * registered and how it told each piece to behave; it knows nothing about
 * the SAM site a custom placement or an ORBAT dropped, the Tigris in an
 * armoured column, or anything the commander bought through LOGCOM. Those
 * are found the way ALiVE's own SEAD task finds them (mil_c2istar
 * fnc_taskSEAD.sqf:78-104): every vehicle profile whose class
 * ALiVE_fnc_isAntiAirCapable says can lock the sky. The behaviour string is
 * "" for those - nobody told them anything.
 *
 * ALIVE_aaProfileBehaviour is an ALiVE hash keyed by profileID, written at
 * placement (mil_placement fnc_MP.sqf:1858, custom fnc_CMP.sqf:2164). Each
 * key is joined against the live profile system and PRUNED when the profile
 * is gone - a pool that remembers dead radars lies to the hunt.
 *
 * An ALiVE hash is a CBA hash: keys at index 1, values at index 2 - CBA's own
 * HASH_KEYS/HASH_VALUES macros (x/cba/addons/hashes/script_hashes.hpp:2-3),
 * as ALiVE reads them itself in x_lib fnc_hashRem.sqf:46. Read in exactly one
 * place - here - so the layout has one consumer if it ever changes.
 *
 * Arguments: None
 *
 * Return Value:
 * [[profileID <STRING>, pos <ARRAY>, side <SIDE>, behaviour <STRING>], ...]
 * behaviour is "static" / "roaming" from placement, "" for the rest.
 * behaviour is "static" / "roaming" from placement, "" for the rest.
 *
 * Example:
 * call ghost_adapter_alive_fnc_aaTargets
