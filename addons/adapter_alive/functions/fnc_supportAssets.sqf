/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * The combat-support assets ALiVE is offering, as neutral rows for
 * TAC//SUPPORT. Read from the NEO radio registry ALiVE's own tablet reads -
 * NEO_radioLogic's per-side arrays, entries [veh, group, callsign, fsm] -
 * verified against the WORKSHOP sup_combatsupport.pbo the game actually
 * loads (the ALiVE.OS checkout is a newer dev tree and is not the authority).
 * The adapter is the only addon allowed to know these names.
 *
 * STATUS is ALiVE's own token, passed through lowercased so the app can say
 * what the unit is really doing. The FSMs write MISSION / RTB / SMOKE /
 * SMOKECONF / CARGO / MOVE / RESPONSE / NOAMMO, and "" / NONE when free -
 * only "MISSION" counted as busy before, so a helo inbound on a pickup read
 * as idle and the RTB button never armed mid-task.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * None
 *
 * Return Value:
 * Assets <ARRAY> of [id, type "cas"|"transport"|"arty", callsign, platform,
 * status "idle"|lowercased FSM token, ordnance [[type, rounds left], ...] -
 * arty only, [] for air, alive gun count - arty only, 0 for air]
 *
 * Public: No
