#include "script_component.hpp"
/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * Makes a ghost site an OPCOM objective, so the commander defends it, sends
 * TACOM orders around it and counts it when he weighs the war.
 *
 * Ghost stands up coastal batteries and drone caches that ALiVE knows nothing
 * about, and a thing the commander does not know he owns is a thing he never
 * garrisons. addObjective is ALiVE's public door for this (mil_opcom
 * fnc_OPCOM.sqf:2869); the objective is a MIL one at the given priority.
 *
 * CONVENTIONAL COMMANDERS ONLY. An asymmetric OPCOM builds installations on
 * whatever objectives it holds; handing it a battery would turn the battery
 * into an IED factory. Its rear is the safe house chain, ghost's own.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Side <SIDE>
 * 1: Id <STRING> - unique, stable
 * 2: Position <ARRAY>
 * 3: Size <NUMBER> - objective radius
 * 4: Priority <NUMBER> (optional, default 60; lower is higher)
 *
 * Return Value:
 * Registered <BOOL>
 *
 * Example:
 * [east, "as_123456", _pos, 150] call ghost_adapter_alive_fnc_registerSite
 *
 * Public: No

// addObjective writes to it on the same path that appends to the list
// (:3160), so for an id we ourselves registered the index is authoritative
