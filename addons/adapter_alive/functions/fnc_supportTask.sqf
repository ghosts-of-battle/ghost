/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * Issues one tasking to an ALiVE combat-support asset, the way ALiVE's own
 * tablet does: the asset's FSM watches a variable on the vehicle, so tasking
 * is one setVariable in the FSM's exact shape.
 *
 * VERIFIED AGAINST THE WORKSHOP BUILD THE GAME LOADS - sup_combatsupport.pbo,
 * unpacked - not against the ALiVE.OS checkout, which is a newer dev tree
 * that has drifted from the release. Both were read; where they differ, the
 * pbo wins, because the pbo is what answers.
 *
 *   CAS:       NEO_radioCasNewTask [task, pos, radius, height, weapon, ROE, player, loiter]
 *   transport: NEO_radioTransportNewTask [task, pos, amnt, player]
 *              (the ARRAY registry keeps ALiVE's missing-n "Trasport"; the
 *              task variable is spelt correctly - both checked in the pbo)
 *   arty:      NEO_radioArtyNewTask [type, ordnance, rate, count, dispersion,
 *              pos, group, magazine, player callsign, player] and the status
 *              flipped to "MISSION" so the row reads busy at once
 *   RTB:       air - task "RTB"; arty - the NEO_radioArtyGoToBase flag
 *
 * EVERY PRESS LANDS IN THE RPT, AND EVERY ACCEPTED ORDER IS RECEIPTED. The
 * FSM nils the task variable the moment it takes the order, so a watcher on
 * that variable IS the delivery receipt - raised back to the app as the
 * QGVAR(supportAck) event with the callsign, or a no-ack warning after 20s.
 * A day of testing produced "nothing happened" with nothing in the log on
 * either side of the handoff; silence was the bug on top of the bug.
 *
 * The request is also read out on the side channel through ALiVE's own
 * NEO_fnc_messageBroadcast, exactly as the tablet's confirm buttons do, so an
 * accepted order is heard in-world and not only in the app.
 *
 * Artillery gets a range pre-check with inRangeOfArtillery - the same call
 * the FSM validates with AFTER consuming the task. ALiVE answers an
 * out-of-range mission with a radio "cannot comply" and nothing else; the
 * app says it up front, with the distance, before the order is sent.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Asset id from FUNC(supportAssets), "type:index" <STRING>
 * 1: Task token <STRING>
 * 2: Position <ARRAY> (optional for AIR - defaults to the caller's own
 *    position, "overhead me". REQUIRED for artillery: a fire mission is
 *    never defaulted onto the caller's own grid.)
 * 3: Parameters [radius, alt, roeIdx, speedIdx, ordIdx, countIdx,
 *    dispersion, guns] <ARRAY> - air reads the first four, arty the last
 *    four (guns 0 or absent = the whole battery)
 *
 * Return Value:
 * 0: Accepted <BOOL>
 * 1: Why not, "" when accepted <STRING>
 *
 * Public: No
