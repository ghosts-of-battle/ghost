/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * Every ALiVE AI commander: who it is, what kind of war it runs, what it
 * fights with, and its module logic.
 *
 * THE LOGIC IS RESOLVED BY POSITION, not read from the instance. Verified in
 * source: the OPCOM handler hash (fnc_OPCOM.sqf:288-300) carries side,
 * factions, controltype and position - but NOT the module object. The TAOR
 * read needs the module, because placements are synchronised to it, so the
 * nearest OPCOM module logic to the instance's own position is matched here,
 * once, in the one place that knows about it.
 *
 * A commander whose logic does not resolve still comes back - with objNull -
 * so probe 1 shows the failure instead of silently reporting no TAORs.
 *
 * Arguments: None
 *
 * Return Value:
 * [[side <SIDE>, controltype <STRING>, faction <STRING>, logic <OBJECT>,
 * instance <ARRAY>], ...] - controltype is "invasion", "occupation" or
 * "asymmetric" <ARRAY>
 *
 * Example:
 * call ghost_adapter_alive_fnc_commanders
