/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * A side's ground, as its own placements declared it (new.md section 4): the
 * union of the "taor" marker lists, and separately the "blacklist" lists, of
 * every placement module that BELONGS TO THAT SIDE.
 *
 * WHOSE PLACEMENT IT IS, IS READ OFF THE PLACEMENT - NOT OFF WHAT IT IS
 * SYNCHRONISED TO. This walked each commander's synchronizedObjects and took
 * every placement it found there as that commander's own, and that is wrong on
 * any mission wired the way ALiVE actually documents: placements are matched to
 * commanders by FACTION, and syncing every placement to every OPCOM is a normal
 * and common way to build the map. On this collection's own Tanoa mission all
 * three OPCOMs - west, east and independent - are synchronised to all three
 * placement sets, so every side came back owning "red", "blue" AND "green".
 *
 * That is not a cosmetic error. A side that owns every TAOR passes
 * EFUNC(common,taorGate) everywhere: the gate's own-ground half is satisfied by
 * any marker, and the foreign-ground half subtracts anything the side "claims",
 * which was everything. The RPT shows what that looked like - fifty-five UAS
 * patrols, not one gate refusal, not one objective dropped, and green drones
 * orbiting inside the red TAOR while red ones orbited inside the green. Every
 * consumer of this function was affected the same way: air defence batteries,
 * QRF origins, insurgent safe houses, drone caches.
 *
 * So the owner is the placement's OWN faction, turned into a side by
 * EFUNC(common,sideOfFaction). Only a placement that declares no faction at all
 * - ALiVE's IED module is one - falls back to the commander it is synced to,
 * and only when it is synced to exactly ONE: two commanders and nobody can say
 * whose ground it describes, so it is dropped rather than handed to both.
 *
 * The keys are plain object variables on the placement logic - verified:
 * mil_placement fnc_MP.sqf:346/360 and civ_placement fnc_CP.sqf:208/222 -
 * holding an ARRAY of marker names. They arrive from Eden as a comma
 * separated STRING and are split at module init, so a read that races that
 * can still see the string; both shapes are accepted rather than trusting
 * the timing. "faction" is read the same way and is a plain string.
 *
 * An empty taor list means the whole map minus the blacklist - ALiVE's own
 * convention, passed through untouched.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Side <SIDE>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * [taorMarkers <ARRAY of STRING>, blacklistMarkers <ARRAY of STRING>]
 *
 * Example:
 * [east] call ghost_adapter_alive_fnc_taorFor
