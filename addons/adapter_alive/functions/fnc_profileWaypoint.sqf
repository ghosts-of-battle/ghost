#include "script_component.hpp"
/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * Sends a profiled group somewhere, virtually: the profile walks the map
 * without its units existing and materialises near players.
 *
 * The call is "addWaypoint" on ALIVE_fnc_profileEntity - NOT ALIVE_fnc_profile,
 * which has no such operation and would accept the call and do nothing. The
 * pattern is ALiVE's own (mil_c2istar/tasks/fnc_taskCheckpointPartnership.sqf
 * :126-128).
 *
 * Waypoint argument order is createProfileWaypoint's own
 * (sys_profile/fnc_createProfileWaypoint.sqf:44-58) - note the SECOND
 * argument is the random PLACEMENT radius, and the completion radius is the
 * fifth. Passing a completion radius in slot two is the easy mistake and
 * scatters the destination instead of tightening it.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Profile entity, as FUNC(profileGroup) returns <ARRAY>
 * 1: Destination <ARRAY>
 * 2: Completion radius (m) <NUMBER> (optional, default 50)
 * 3: Waypoint type <STRING> (optional, default "MOVE")
 *
 * Return Value:
 * Waypoint handed over <BOOL>
 *
 * Example:
 * [_profile, getPosATL player, 100] call ghost_adapter_alive_fnc_profileWaypoint
