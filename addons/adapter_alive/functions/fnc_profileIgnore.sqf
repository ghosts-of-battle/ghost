#include "script_component.hpp"
/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * Marks a vehicle or a group - and everything inside it - as ALiVE's to leave
 * alone.
 *
 * THE VARIABLE IS ALiVE'S AND SO THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE IT MAY BE NAMED. Every
 * ghost system that spawns something and means to keep it was setting
 * ALIVE_profileIgnore by hand: air defence in three files, the patrol drones in
 * one, twelve references in all. That is a foreign symbol copied through four
 * addons and four places to fix when ALiVE renames it, and it is what
 * check_invariants.py had been failing on. They all come here now.
 *
 * WHAT IT BUYS: ALiVE's runtime profiler replaces objects with records that
 * walk the map, and it does that by DELETING what it was handed - see the note
 * in the drone top-up, which traced a fleet of vanishing airframes to exactly
 * that. An aircraft mid-strike, a battery mid-engagement or a MANPAD team on a
 * ridge must not be virtualised out from under the system that placed it. This
 * is ALiVE's own documented opt-out, honoured by the same function that does
 * the deleting.
 *
 * THE WHOLE SET, NOT THE HANDLE. The profiler tests a GROUP and spares it only
 * when every unit in it is exempt, so marking the vehicle alone leaves the crew
 * to fail the test and take the vehicle with them. Hardware, crew, and the
 * group the crew is in - all three, every time.
 *
 * OBJECT OR GROUP, because the callers have both: a drone is an airframe, a
 * security element is a group, and a battery is a list of guns whose gunners
 * live in a group of their own. Asking each caller to know which shape to
 * unpack is how the twelve copies happened.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: The object or group <OBJECT|GROUP>
 *
 * Return Value: None
 *
 * Example:
 * [_veh] call ghost_adapter_alive_fnc_profileIgnore
 * [_grp] call ghost_adapter_alive_fnc_profileIgnore
 *
 * Public: Yes
