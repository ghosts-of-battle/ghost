/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * Wave 1: shells, scaled to the ground taken.
 *
 * A conventional commander is ASKED - an ARTY_REQUEST to its own guns, which
 * it services only if it has a battery in range with ammunition. The request
 * is backed by a contact count scaled to the ground taken, and what that
 * buys is the battery's own decision. There is no fallback barrage here: a
 * commander with no guns should not conjure them, and a mission where nothing
 * answers is telling the players something true about the enemy they are
 * fighting.
 *
 * An asymmetric commander has no gun line at all - 3-4 mortar rounds about
 * half the time, delivered directly, or nothing.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Answering side <SIDE>
 * 1: Its controltype <STRING>
 * 2: Objective position <ARRAY>
 * 3: Objective radius <NUMBER>
 *
 * Return Value: None
 *
 * Public: No
