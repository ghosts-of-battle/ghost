/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * Wave 3: men, and they WALK IN.
 *
 * Spawned at TAOR-valid origins three to six kilometres out, profiled the
 * moment they exist, and given a profile waypoint onto the objective. So they
 * cross the map virtually and materialise when the players can see them -
 * they arrive, rather than appearing.
 *
 * Composition is the answering commander's own faction, read from ALiVE. A
 * faction with no infantry gets nothing and says so, rather than quietly
 * sending somebody else's soldiers.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Answering side <SIDE>
 * 1: Its faction <STRING>
 * 2: Objective position <ARRAY>
 *
 * Return Value: None
 *
 * Public: No
