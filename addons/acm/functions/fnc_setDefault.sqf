#include "script_component.hpp"
/*
 * Author: YonV
 * Changes the DEFAULT of a CBA setting another addon has already registered,
 * keeping everything else about it - its title, tooltip, category, value list,
 * labels, who may change it and its on-change script.
 *
 * A DEFAULT, NOT A VALUE. CBA re-registers a setting in place when it is added
 * a second time, so this adds it again from CBA's own record with one thing
 * different. Anything a server, a mission or a player has set still wins over
 * it, exactly as it would over the owner's default - which is the point: the
 * unit gets Ghost's tiers out of the box and can still change any of them in
 * the settings menu.
 *
 * Must run after the owner's preInit, which is what requiredAddons orders.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Setting name <STRING>
 * 1: New default <ANY> - for a LIST, one of its values
 *
 * Return Value:
 * Whether the default was changed <BOOL>
 *
 * Example:
 * ["ACM_airway_allowOPA", SKILL_CLS] call ghost_acm_fnc_setDefault
 *
 * Public: No
