// THE SCANNER MUST NOT BE ON THE MAIN MENU. The handset overlay is a title
// layer put up with cutRsc, and a named title layer outlives the mission
// that raised it: the user photographed this sitting over QUICK PLAY three
// times. Clearing the layer by name is what FUNC(scannerClose) does and it
// is not enough once the mission is gone - there is nothing left for a
// title command to address - so the display is closed directly, by its own
// id, which still resolves in the menu.
//
// The tick handler goes too. A per-frame handler registered with CBA runs
// on in the menu, and one drawing into a display that has just been closed
// is the next stuck widget.
//
// Safe with nothing up: clearing a clear layer, closing a null display and
// removing a handler that is not running are all no-ops. This must never
// be the thing that throws in the main menu.

// Never while a mission is live - see the same guard in hud's menuClear.
