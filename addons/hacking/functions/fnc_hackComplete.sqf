Function: ghost_hacking_fnc_hackComplete

Description:
    A hack finished. What happens next depends on what was hacked and, for towers
    and units, on the intel chosen before it started - the pick is already made,
    so completion just cashes it in.

Parameters:
    _device : OBJECT - what was hacked.
    _kind   : STRING - "tower" | "drone" | "wreck" | "unit".
    _intel  : STRING - the chosen product, or "none" for a drone.

// is never told why.
// ONE FLAT GUARD AT FUNCTION SCOPE. The roll used to exitWith inside the
// then-block, which exits only the block - "Intrusion FAILED" printed, the
// reaction fired, and the hack then delivered anyway. A tower could never
