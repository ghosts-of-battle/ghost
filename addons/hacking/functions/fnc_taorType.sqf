Function: ghost_hacking_fnc_taorType

Description:
    What kind of war is being fought where this hack happened - "invasion",
    "occupation", "asymmetric", or "" for nowhere.

    THIS IS WHAT SCOPES THE PRODUCT MENU. A hack inside a conventional
    commander's ground finds air defence, coastal batteries, radars and
    artillery; one inside an asymmetric commander's ground finds leaders and
    installations. The hack tells you what kind of war you are in, and a menu
    that offered both everywhere told you nothing.

    NO MODULE, NO SETTING. ALiVE's OPCOM already says this - `controltype` on
    the instance, read by EFUNC(adapter_alive,commanders) - and its placement
    modules already say where each commander's ground is, read by
    EFUNC(adapter_alive,taorFor). Asking a mission maker to draw the same
    boundary a second time is how the two answers start to disagree.

    AN EXPLICIT TAOR BEATS AN IMPLICIT ONE. A commander with no taor markers
    owns the whole map minus its blacklist, which is ALiVE's own convention -
    so on a map with one conventional commander (no markers) and one asymmetric
    commander (markers round three towns), a hack in one of those towns has to
    answer "asymmetric". The explicit matches are taken first for exactly that.

Parameters:
    0: Position <ARRAY>

Returns:
    STRING - controltype, or "" when no commander holds this ground.

Example:
    private _type = [getPosATL player] call ghost_hacking_fnc_taorType
