// NO DEVICE, AND NO REQUIREMENT. Carrying a scanner used to be the gate, and
// for one build it was a flag that defaulted to false - which is the same
// requirement wearing different clothes.
//
// It DEFAULTS TRUE: everyone sweeps unless a mission says otherwise. The
// variable is still read, so setting it false on a unit denies them the
// scanner, which is the only thing a mission is likely to want.
