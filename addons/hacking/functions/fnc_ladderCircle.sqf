/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * ONE SITE AT A TIME, tightening. The shared body behind LOCATE AA and
 * LOCATE ARTILLERY: both used to answer differently and neither did this.
 *
 * The rules, in full, because every one of them is a decision:
 *
 *   ONE target, never the pool. Plotting every battery at once turns a hack
 *   into a map reveal - there is nothing left to hunt.
 *
 *   The NEAREST one when the lock is taken, and then THAT ONE STAYS. The lock
 *   is not re-taken while it lives: walking 500 m must not restart the ladder
 *   on a different battery, or the circle never tightens and the mechanic is
 *   just noise.
 *
 *   Each further hack draws a SMALLER circle on the SAME site - 3000, then
 *   2000, then 1000 by default. The last radius repeats, so a fully worked
 *   site keeps its tight circle instead of jittering.
 *
 *   Always OFF CENTRE, on a bearing fixed when the lock is taken. The throw
 *   shrinks with the radius, so the circles close in from one side and the
 *   real position is inside every one of them. A re-roll per tier would let a
 *   player hack repeatedly and average out the truth.
 *
 *   Only when the site is GONE from the pool does the lock move to the next
 *   nearest - destroy it, and the next one is what you get.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Candidate sites, [id, position, side] each <ARRAY>
 * 1: Where the hack happened <ARRAY>
 * 2: The side being told <SIDE>
 * 3: Lock store, keyed by side <HASHMAP>
 * 4: Marker key, unique per product <STRING>
 * 5: Label drawn on the circle <STRING>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * Something was drawn <BOOL>
 *
 * Example:
 * [_pool, _pos, west, GVAR(aaLock), "aa", "AIR DEFENCE"] call ghost_hacking_fnc_ladderCircle
