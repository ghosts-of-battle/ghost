Function: ghost_hacking_fnc_scannerRead

Description:
    One sweep of everything the scanner shows. Kept separate from the drawing so
    the readings can be tested on their own (see #ghost hack.scan) and so the
    screen never contains logic.

    Every value is read live from the player's own position, which is the whole
    point of a hand-held: walking changes the answer.

Returns:
    ARRAY - [_droneState, _droneDist, _droneDir, _jamFactor, _chanText, _freqText,
             _meshCount, _droneTag]. _droneDir is a compass bearing, -1 when
             nothing is up; _droneTag is "faction / airframe", "" when clear.
            _droneState 0 clear / 1 warn / 2 alert.
            The net reading comes back as two strings rather than one sentence
            because the screen prints them in separate columns.

// CACHED, because this is the most expensive thing the devices do and it was
// being run more than once a second on every client with a device open.
//
// The drone sweep alone is a nearEntities over TWO KILOMETRES, and on an ALiVE
// map that is a lot of entities to walk. widgetTick calls this once a second
// for the dashboard lamps, and the drone page's own refresh calls it again -
// so with that page up the sweep ran twice a second, forever, for a readout
// that cannot meaningfully change that fast.
//
// One sweep per SCN_CACHE_TTL, shared by every caller. uiNamespace rather than
// missionNamespace: this is a client-local reading about the player standing
// here, and nothing on the server has any business reading it.
