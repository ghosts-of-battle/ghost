/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * LOCATE ANTI-SHIP: the coastal batteries themselves.
 *
 * Ghost spawns these rather than reading them off ALiVE (new.md section 1.2),
 * so the pool is the addon's own registry rather than an adapter call. A
 * mission running without the anti-ship module gets an empty pool and this
 * product is never offered - see FUNC(intelOptions).
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Where the hack happened <ARRAY>
 * 1: Asking side <SIDE>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * Anything plotted <BOOL>
 *
 * Public: No
