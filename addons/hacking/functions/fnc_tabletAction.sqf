Function: ghost_hacking_fnc_tabletAction

Description:
    START / ABORT. Starting validates the target the way the old ACE actions did
    - cooldowns for towers, range for everything - and refuses with a reason
    rather than silently doing nothing.

    Aborting throws the progress away deliberately. Closing the tablet is the way
    to pause; the button is the way to give up.
