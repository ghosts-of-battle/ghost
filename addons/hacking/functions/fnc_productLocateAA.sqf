 * Author: Ghost
 * LOCATE AA: every hostile air-defence piece, plotted exactly.
 *
 * Exact on purpose. Air defence is hunted to be UN-INTEGRATED (new.md
 * section 1) - a fuzzy SAM ring is a navigation hazard rather than a target,
 * and the work of finding it was already paid for by getting into the tower.
 *
 * The plot is a SNAPSHOT at hack time: the profile may move afterwards and
 * the map does not follow it. Same grammar as every other product.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Where the hack happened <ARRAY>
 * 1: Asking side <SIDE>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * Anything plotted <BOOL>
 *
 * Public: No
