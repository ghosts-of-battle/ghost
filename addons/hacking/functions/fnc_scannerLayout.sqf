Function: ghost_hacking_fnc_scannerLayout

Description:
    Places the handset at the player's saved position and lays the screen out on
    a fixed line grid. Like every ghost HUD it can be dragged somewhere else - a
    device you hold should not be stuck where someone else thought it belonged.

    Everything is derived from one number, SCN_H, so the device scales as a unit
    and the type always fits the glass: font height comes from the row height
    rather than from a config constant that only happened to look right on one
    monitor. That was the old screen's problem.

Parameters:
    _display : DISPLAY - the scanner layer.
