/* ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Function: ghost_hacking_fnc_scanDevices

Description:
    Everything hackable within reach, as one list for the tablet: comm towers and
    EW emitters, live enemy drones, downed ones, and enemy soldiers. Each kind
    keeps its own range, so a wreck you must stand over and a soldier 800 m away
    can sit on the same screen without pretending they are the same thing.

    Sorted nearest first and capped at the number of cards the screen has - if
    there are more devices than slots, the far ones are the ones you cannot see,
    which is the right way round.

Parameters:
    _unit : OBJECT - the operator.

Returns:
    ARRAY - [[_object, _kind, _label, _distance, _range], ...]
            _kind is "tower" | "drone" | "wreck" | "unit".
