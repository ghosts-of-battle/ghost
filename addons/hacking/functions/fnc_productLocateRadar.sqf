 * Author: Ghost
 * LOCATE RADAR: the coastal network's eyes, on the shrinking circle ladder.
 *
 * A RADAR IS A SEPARATE TARGET FROM THE BATTERY IT FEEDS. The anti-ship design
 * splits them deliberately - kill the radar and the launchers are firing blind,
 * kill the launchers and the radar is still watching for the next lot. One
 * product for "the coastal site" would have hidden that split behind a single
 * circle.
 *
 * The pool is read off the live radar objects rather than a registry of
 * positions: a set that has been destroyed drops out on its own, which is what
 * makes working the coast feel like it is going somewhere.
 *
 * NOT FRIENDLY, rather than hostile. A radar is a building with an aerial - one
 * placed in Eden and never crewed answers `side` as civilian, and a
 * getFriend test would quietly exclude every one of them. The rule is that you
 * cannot hunt your own.
 *
 * Same ladder as everything else - see FUNC(ladderCircle) for the rules.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Where the hack happened <ARRAY>
 * 1: Asking side <SIDE>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * Anything plotted <BOOL>
 *
 * Public: No
