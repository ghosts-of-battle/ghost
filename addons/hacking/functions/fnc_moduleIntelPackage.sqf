Function: ghost_hacking_fnc_moduleIntelPackage

Description:
    Puts an intel package on a hackable device, so breaking into that device
    hands over what the mission maker wrote rather than what a simulation
    happened to contain.

    SYNCHRONISE IT, OR IT BUILDS ITS OWN TERMINAL. Attached to something, that
    something carries the package. Attached to nothing, a data terminal is
    created where the module stands - because the common case in Zeus is "put an
    intel objective HERE" and making somebody place a prop first is a step that
    teaches nothing.

    THE PACKAGE IS A NAME, NOT CONTENT. What is in it lives in the mission's own
    config under Ghost_IntelPackages - see FUNC(packageEntries) for the shape.
    This module says which package is on which device, and nothing else: the
    writing is mission content and belongs in the mission, where it can be
    edited without a rebuild and read by somebody who is not looking at Eden.

    IT VALIDATES AT PLACEMENT. A package name that is not in the mission config
    is a typo the mission maker will otherwise discover when a player hacks the
    terminal and is told there is nothing on it. It says so now, in the RPT and
    on the Zeus's screen, while they are still standing next to it.

    ONE PACKAGE PER DEVICE. Placing a second module on the same object replaces
    the first - the device carries one package, and two would mean the share
    arithmetic had to decide which to draw from.

Parameters:
    0: The module logic <OBJECT>
    1: Synchronised units <ARRAY>
    2: Activated <BOOL>

Returns:
    None

Public: No
