Function: ghost_hacking_fnc_alarmArm

Description:
    Arms an alarm from a client, and says so.

    THE ROSTER IS THE SERVER'S - see FUNC(alarmAdd) - because an alarm has to
    ring whether or not the man who set it is still around. This is the client
    half: it sends, and it confirms, so pressing an interaction entry produces
    something on screen rather than silence and a hope.

    Called from the ACE self-interaction menu and from anywhere else that wants
    to arm without knowing about the network.

Parameters:
    0: NUMBER - seconds from now.
    1: STRING - who set it. Optional, default the player's name.

Returns:
    BOOL - true if it was sent.

Example:
    [300, name player] call ghost_hacking_fnc_alarmArm
