/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * LOCATE ARTILLERY: the nearest hostile battery, on the shrinking ladder.
 *
 * Fuzzed rather than exact, and shrinking per hack against the SAME battery -
 * the guns are a bigger prize than a radar, so finding them is work rather
 * than a single button.
 *
 * THE THROW IS CACHED PER BATTERY PER TIER. Re-hacking for the same tier
 * re-draws the identical circle instead of rolling a luckier centre, which is
 * the rule the target circles already follow. Profiles are not objects and
 * cannot carry an object variable, so the cache is a hashmap keyed by
 * profileID, here on the server.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Where the hack happened <ARRAY>
 * 1: Asking side <SIDE>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * Anything drawn <BOOL>
 *
 * Public: No
