/*
 * Author: YonV
 * Whose drone this is and what sort of airframe it is - the two things a
 * bearing and a range do not tell you.
 *
 * A contact on the scanner says to worry and which way to look; it does not
 * say whether that is somebody's recon quad or a gunship, which is the part
 * that decides what you do about it.
 *
 * Moved here from ctab_devices when cTab was dropped. It was always our code
 * and never cTab's - it only lived there because that is where the list it fed
 * was drawn.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: The drone <OBJECT>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * Faction and airframe, ready to append to a row <STRING>
 *
 * Example:
 * [_uav] call ghost_hacking_fnc_droneTag
 *
 * Public: Yes
