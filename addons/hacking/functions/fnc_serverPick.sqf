Function: ghost_hacking_fnc_serverPick

Description:
    Server end of the choice menu. Builds the snapshot for the chosen product and
    broadcasts the render. Everything that decides WHAT the intel is happens
    here, on one machine, so two clients can never disagree about it.

Parameters:
    _product : STRING - "package" | "aa" | "arty" | "camp" | "hub" |
               "installation" | "coastal" | "radar" | "jam" | "leader".
    _pos     : ARRAY  - where the hack happened.
    _side    : SIDE   - who earned it.
    _caller  : OBJECT - the hacker.
    _device  : OBJECT - what was hacked. The package lives on it.

Author:
    Ghost
