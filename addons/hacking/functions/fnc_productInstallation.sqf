 * Author: Ghost
 * LOCATE INSTALLATION: the asymmetric commander's physical network - the
 * factory, the HQ, the depot, the roadblocks (new.md section 5).
 *
 * THE OTHER HALF OF THE ASYMMETRIC HUNT. TRACE NETWORK points at the men and
 * the houses they sleep in; this points at the things they need to keep
 * working. Both run the same ladder, so a section that keeps hacking closes on
 * one installation rather than being handed the set.
 *
 * The pool is ALiVE's own objective list, read through the adapter - ghost
 * places none of it and invents none of it, so a map whose asymmetric commander
 * has no installations returns empty and the product is never offered.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Where the hack happened <ARRAY>
 * 1: Asking side <SIDE>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * Anything plotted <BOOL>
 *
 * Public: No
