Function: ghost_hacking_fnc_alarmRing

Description:
    An alarm has gone off. This runs on every machine - the whole point of the
    thing is that one person sets it and the entire server's phones go - but a
    phone only rings if you are carrying one, so a player with neither the
    scanner nor a cTab device hears nothing, exactly as if their pocket were
    empty.

    A cTab counts: its alarm app arms these same alarms, and an alarm you can
    set on a device but never hear from it is a clock with no bell.

    The ring is a beep on a slow loop plus the blinking row the screen paints
    from GVAR(alarmRingUntil), and it gives up on its own after SCN_ALARM_RING
    seconds because an alarm nobody dismisses has still done its job. A second
    alarm landing mid-ring just pushes the deadline back; there is one beeper,
    not one per alarm.

Parameters:
    _name : STRING - who set it.
