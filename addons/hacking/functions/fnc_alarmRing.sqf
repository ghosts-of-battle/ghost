Function: ghost_hacking_fnc_alarmRing

Description:
    An alarm has gone off. This runs on every machine - the whole point of the
    thing is that one person sets it and the entire server's phones go - but a
    phone only rings if you are carrying one, so a player carrying no scanner
    hears nothing, exactly as if their pocket were empty.

    What counts as a scanner is the Scanner Items setting, which is wider than
    the terminal on purpose - an alarm you can set on a device but never hear
    from it is a clock with no bell.

    The ring is a beep on a slow loop plus the blinking row the screen paints
    from GVAR(alarmRingUntil), and it gives up on its own after SCN_ALARM_RING
    seconds because an alarm nobody dismisses has still done its job. A second
    alarm landing mid-ring just pushes the deadline back; there is one beeper,
    not one per alarm.

Parameters:
    _name : STRING - who set it.
