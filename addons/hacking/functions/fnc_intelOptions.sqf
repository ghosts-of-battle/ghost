Function: ghost_hacking_fnc_intelOptions

Description:
    What this hack could be made to produce, given where it is happening and
    what the mission currently has. Also keeps the session's choice valid when
    the list changes under it.

    It lived inside FUNC(tabletRefresh), which meant the answer only existed
    while the suite's own dialog was on screen - anything else that wanted to
    offer the same choices had to work them out again and could disagree. It is
    a question about the mission, not about a display.

    WHAT THIS DEVICE CAN BE MADE TO PRODUCE. A package if somebody put one on
    it, plus whatever hunts the mission currently has anything to hunt.

    IT WAS SCOPED BY TAOR, AND IS NOT ANY MORE. FUNC(taorType) asked ALiVE which
    commander held the spot and what kind of war it was fighting - invasion and
    occupation offered the integrated defence network, asymmetric offered the
    leader chain. That question died with ALiVE, and it was the wrong question:
    what a terminal can tell you is a fact about the terminal, which is now
    exactly what a mission maker writes on it.

    AN EMPTY LIST IS STILL POSSIBLE and still says so. A device nobody put a
    package on, on a map with no anti-ship, no jammers and no leaders, has
    nothing to offer - and a button that can only ever say "nothing" teaches
    players to stop reading the list.

Parameters:
    _session : HASHMAP - the tablet session. Optional, default the live one.

Returns:
    ARRAY - [id, label] pairs, capped at TAB_INTEL.
