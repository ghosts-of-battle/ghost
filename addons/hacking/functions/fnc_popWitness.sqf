/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * A hack on an internet pop, checked for witnesses. A pop is public
 * furniture in a settlement: any civilian close enough with eyes on the
 * hacker remembers it, and the settlement's hostility toward the hacker's
 * side goes up - through ALiVE's own ledger, on the server, never a rebuilt
 * one. Real comms towers carry no such audience; only tagged pops call this.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: The hacker <OBJECT>
 * 1: The pop <OBJECT>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * None
 *
 * Example:
 * [player, _pop] call ghost_hacking_fnc_popWitness
