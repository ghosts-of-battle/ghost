Function: ghost_hacking_fnc_tabletInRange

Description:
    Is the selected device still close enough to work on? One test for all three
    kinds - each carries its own range in the session, so a tower and a soldier
    are checked against their own numbers.

Parameters:
    _device  : OBJECT  - the target.
    _session : HASHMAP - the tablet session.

Returns:
    BOOL

// A SESSION WITHOUT A RANGE IS NOT OUT OF RANGE. `get` answered nil for a

// false - so the hack ran with the progress permanently refused and nothing on
// screen said why. The tower range is the honest default.
