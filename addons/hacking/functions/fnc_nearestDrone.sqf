Function: ghost_hacking_fnc_nearestDrone

Description:
    Nearest hostile UAV/UGV (isUav) within HACK_DRONE_RANGE, not on the player's
    own side and not already hacked. Covers flying drones and ground UGVs.

    EVERY DRONE IS HACKABLE by default - the setting ships blank, and blank means
    any enemy UAV. GVAR(droneClasses) is there for a mission that wants to
    protect a specific airframe from being taken, not as the thing that makes
    drones hackable in the first place. Matching is by inheritance, so listing a
    base class covers everything derived from it.

Parameters:
    _unit : OBJECT - the player.

Returns:
    OBJECT - nearest downable drone, or objNull.
