#include "script_component.hpp"
/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * Takes back every patrol nobody is near any more.
 *
 * THE OTHER HALF OF THE PROXIMITY RULE. FUNC(topUp) will not put a drone up
 * over ground with no player within UAS_PLAYER_RANGE; without this, one that
 * was up when the section drove away stays up forever - the fleet would only
 * ever grow, and the mission would still be flying twenty airframes over an
 * empty island an hour later.
 *
 * MEASURED TO THE ORBIT CENTRE the patrol was given, not to where the airframe
 * happens to be on its circle - see UAS_PLAYER_RANGE. A patrol with no centre
 * recorded (an airframe put up by a build older than this) is left alone
 * rather than deleted on a guess.
 *
 * THE HUSK IS FLAGGED BEFORE IT GOES, so the Deleted handler FUNC(topUp) put
 * on it knows the removal was ours and stays quiet. A drone taken back on
 * purpose is not "DELETED WHILE STILL FLYING" - that warning is for a script
 * or a garbage collector eating live patrols and is worth keeping loud.
 *
 * Arguments: None
 *
 * Return Value:
 * How many were taken back <NUMBER>
 *
 * Example:
 * call ghost_uas_fnc_standDown
 *
 * Public: No
