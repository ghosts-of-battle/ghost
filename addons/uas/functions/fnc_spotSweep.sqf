/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * A drone that has actually SEEN somebody says so, down the same path a
 * failed hack takes (new.md section 1.3 - one reaction path, no special
 * case). The listener is the reaction ladder; until that exists this raise is
 * a no-op, which is why it is written as an event rather than a call.
 *
 * knowsAbout rather than distance: a drone that flew over without noticing
 * anything reports nothing, and a section that stayed still and cold is not
 * punished for being overflown.
 *
 * Only REAL drones can see - a profiled one is a record and has no sensors -
 * so this walks live aircraft rather than any registry, which also means it
 * covers drones ALiVE put up as well as ghost's own.
 *
 * Parameters (CBA PFH): 0: args, 1: handle
 *
 * Public: No
