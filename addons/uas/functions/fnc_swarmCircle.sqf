Function: ghost_uas_fnc_swarmCircle

Description:
    One drone of a circling swarm: spawned on the ring, given a loiter waypoint,
    and then left alone.

    IT IS LEFT ALONE ON PURPOSE. An impact drone is flown by a steering loop
    because it is a weapon with no opinion; a circling one has a crew, sensors
    and usually a gun, and what it does with a target it finds is its own
    business. Writing its velocity would fight the very AI that makes it worth
    fielding - so this puts it on station and stops.

    THEY FLY IN. Each spawns out at the module's spawn band and the LOITER
    waypoint brings it to the ring - a swarm appearing already on station is one
    nobody got to hear coming.

    SPACED AROUND THE RING, not stacked. Each drone takes its own slice of the
    circle from its index, so eight of them are eight bearings rather than eight
    aircraft in one spot arguing about the same piece of air. Altitude is
    staggered with it, because a stack that shares one height is a stack that
    collides.

    NO STAND-DOWN AND NO REPLACEMENT. A swarm is an event, not a presence: what
    is launched is what there is, and when it is dead it is dead. That is
    FUNC(moduleDronePatrol)'s job and the reason the two modules are separate.

Parameters:
    0: Airframe class <STRING>
    1: Side <SIDE>
    2: Centre position ATL <ARRAY>
    3: Orbit radius <NUMBER>
    4: This drone's index in the swarm <NUMBER>
    5: How many in the swarm <NUMBER>
    6: Nearest it may spawn, m <NUMBER>
    7: Furthest it may spawn, m <NUMBER>

Returns:
    Whether it got airborne <BOOL>
