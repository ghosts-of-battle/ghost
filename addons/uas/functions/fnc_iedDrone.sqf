/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * Arms an IED Pelican: a cargo quad with a charge where the crate was.
 *
 * TWO TRIGGERS, ONE BANG. Drongo's Drone Tweaks flies the thing - it is
 * registered with DDT as an FPV in XEH_postInit, so an AI operator deploys
 * it and DDT guides it into whatever it finds - but DDT only ever crashes an
 * airframe; the mods whose FPVs it flies explode on their own. This one has
 * no warhead in its config, so:
 *
 *   PROXIMITY  - a hostile inside UAS_IED_RADIUS sets it off. That is the
 *                "prox explosive" the brief asked for, and it is what makes
 *                the drone lethal at the end of a DDT run, where the flight
 *                model rarely gets a clean hit.
 *   KILLED     - shot down, crashed, or set off by the above: the charge goes
 *                either way. Nothing gets to pick the drone up and defuse it.
 *
 * ARMS LATE AND NEVER ON FRIENDS. The proximity check ignores the drone's own
 * side and does not start until UAS_IED_ARM_DELAY after spawn, so a bird
 * assembled at the operator's feet does not take the operator with it.
 *
 * SERVER ONLY. The drone is created on the server - by DDT's deploy, by
 * ALiVE, by Zeus - and stays local there; a Killed handler on the machine
 * it is local to is the one that fires.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: The drone <OBJECT>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * None
 *
 * Example:
 * [_drone] call ghost_uas_fnc_iedDrone
