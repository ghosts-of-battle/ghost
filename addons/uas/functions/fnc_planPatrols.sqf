 * Puts each side's patrols over the ENEMY's objectives, as PROFILES.
 *
 * Reconnaissance flies where the enemy is. Every side used to orbit its own
 * ground, which meant west drones over west towns and east drones over east
 * ones - two air forces watching their own people and never meeting anybody.
 * A side's eyes belong over the ground it is trying to see into, and that is
 * also where its drones become something players have to deal with.
 *
 * The module can put them back over their own ground (overwatch) for missions
 * that want that, and a side with no enemy objectives on the map falls back
 * to its own rather than losing its air.
 *
 * A profiled drone is not a flying object - it is a record that walks the map
 * and becomes real only when players are near enough for ALiVE to spawn it.
 * That is the whole reason patrols are profiled rather than flown: an empty
 * map costs nothing, and the drone a section actually meets was always there.

// drones the user photographed over the red TAOR came from. A side friendly to
// the players gets none.

// and an empty one falls through to FUNC(factionUav) scanning by side - so the
// faction string this used to carry has nothing left to say.

// and there was no reason to rewrite it around a different one.
