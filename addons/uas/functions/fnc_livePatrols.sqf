 * Author: Ghost
 * How many patrols a side actually has up, pruning the entries that have died
 * since the last look.
 *
 * A patrol is one of two things and the list holds both. A profile ID is a
 * STRING and ALiVE owns its lifetime. An OBJECT is a drone ALiVE refused to
 * profile - it blacklists UAV crew and airframes on purpose - so ghost flies
 * that one live and has to notice when it is shot down.
 *
 * Without this the ceiling counted destroyed airframes forever and the side
 * quietly stopped replacing anything.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: The side <SIDE>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * Patrols still up <NUMBER>
 *
 * Example:
 * [east] call ghost_uas_fnc_livePatrols
