 * Author: Ghost
 * Is anybody near enough for a patrol over this position to be worth flying?
 *
 * THE ONE PLACE THAT ANSWERS IT, because three ask: the planner filtering its
 * objective list, FUNC(topUp) refusing a launch, and FUNC(standDown) taking
 * one back. Three copies of "which players count" is three chances to forget
 * the headless client.
 *
 * WHO COUNTS: a live player, on any side. Not a headless client - it is a
 * machine, it has no eyes and it stands wherever the mission put it, which on
 * this collection is inside somebody's base and would hold every patrol on the
 * map up forever. Not a corpse either; a dead man is not an audience.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Position <ARRAY>
 * 1: Range in metres <NUMBER> (optional, default UAS_PLAYER_RANGE)
 *
 * Return Value:
 * Somebody is within range <BOOL>
 *
 * Example:
 * if ([_pos] call ghost_uas_fnc_playerNear) then {...}
 *
 * Public: No
