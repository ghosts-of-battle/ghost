/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * One patrol: spawn the faction's own UAV, profile it, and give the profile a
 * waypoint over the objective.
 *
 * Called both to stand patrols up and, on the slow tick, to replace ones that
 * died - so shooting a drone down is worth doing and worth doing again, and
 * killing the caches is what stops them coming back at full strength.
 *
 * The dead are pruned here rather than by a watcher: the profile list is only
 * interesting at the moment something wants to add to it.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Side <SIDE>
 * 1: Faction <STRING>
 * 2: Objective position <ARRAY>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * A patrol was put up <BOOL>
 *
 * Public: No
