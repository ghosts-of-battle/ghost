Function: ghost_uas_fnc_moduleDronePatrol

Description:
    One patrol zone: ground a side flies drones over, drawn where you put it.

    WHAT THIS REPLACED. In ghost, patrols orbited each ALiVE commander's own
    objectives - the module said how many airframes and the simulation said
    where. There are no commanders and no objective lists, so the where had
    nothing to read from. A zone is that answer: an area module, sized in Eden
    or Zeus, saying "this side patrols here".

    IT IS SIMPLER THAN WHAT IT REPLACED, on purpose. The old planner had to
    decide whether a side patrolled its own ground or the enemy's, then gate
    every objective through EFUNC(common,taorGate) because an attacker's
    objective list reached into enemy territory - and green patrols orbiting
    inside the red TAOR is what happened when a commander declared no markers.
    A placed zone IS the declaration. There is nothing to gate.

    NOBODY NEAR, NOTHING FLYING - unchanged, and the reason the rest of the
    addon is worth keeping. A zone with no player within UAS_PLAYER_RANGE is not
    patrolled, and FUNC(standDown) retires the ones whose audience has left. An
    empty map costs nothing.

    THE AREA IS THE ORBIT GROUND, not a spawn box. Drones loiter over it; where
    the airframe first appears is FUNC(topUp)'s business and is a stand-off
    position outside it.

Parameters:
    0: The module logic <OBJECT>
    1: Synchronised units <ARRAY>
    2: Activated <BOOL>

Returns:
    None
