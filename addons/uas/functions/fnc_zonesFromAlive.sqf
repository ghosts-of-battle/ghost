Function: ghost_uas_fnc_zonesFromAlive

Description:
    Turns each commander's ALiVE objectives into patrol zones.

    A ZONE IS A ZONE, WHOEVER DREW IT. This does not add a second kind of
    patrol - it appends ordinary entries to QGVAR(zones), the same shape a
    Ghost - Drone Patrol module pushes, so FUNC(planPatrols), FUNC(topUp),
    FUNC(placeCaches), FUNC(spotSweep) and FUNC(ceilingFor) all work on them
    unchanged. That is the whole reason FUNC(zonesFor) was written to return a
    superset of the old objective-list shape.

    ghost had no zones at all: patrols orbited each commander's objectives
    directly, and FUNC(planPatrols) asked the adapter every tick. Doing it once,
    here, means the ALiVE half and the hand-placed half are the same list from
    then on, and neither can shadow the other.

    OFF BY DEFAULT. Loading ALiVE should not silently put drones over every
    objective on the map. QGVAR(aliveZones) is the opt-in, and it stands where
    ghost's Ghost - UAS module stood - that module was the enable, and DIVINER
    deleted it.

    ONCE PER OBJECTIVE, EVER. The id of every objective already turned into a
    zone is kept in QGVAR(aliveZoneIds), so a second call - a commander that
    initialises late, a re-raised ready event - adds the new ones and leaves the
    existing zones alone. Zones are append-only and an index is stable; adding
    the same objective twice would give one piece of ground two ceilings.

    NO ARTILLERY. ALiVE-derived zones never call for fire. A mission that wants
    overflight to land as shells says so on a Drone Patrol module drawn over
    that ground, which is a deliberate decision about one place rather than a
    blanket one about every objective a commander owns.

Parameters:
    None.

Returns:
    NUMBER - zones added by this call.
