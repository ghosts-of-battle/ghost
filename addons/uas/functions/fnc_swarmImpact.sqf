Function: ghost_uas_fnc_swarmImpact

Description:
    One drone of an impact swarm: spawned off the target, flown into it, gone.

    THE SAME DIVE THE AMBIENT KAMIKAZE FLIES, deliberately - a straight steering
    loop that writes velocity at the aim point every step, LAMBS turned off on
    the airframe because an AI taking an interest in it would only fight those
    writes. It is written here rather than called from `ambience` because that
    function picks its own target near a player and gates the spawn on a
    module's markers; a swarm has been told where to go.

    SHOT DOWN IS THE COUNTERPLAY AND IT PAYS OUT. A drone that dies on the way
    in detonates nothing - the handler removes itself and that is one fewer
    warhead arriving. That is the whole reason a swarm is a fight rather than an
    announcement, and why the count on the module matters.

    A SPREAD OF BEARINGS AND DISTANCES, not a queue. Each drone comes from its
    own rolled direction and its own distance inside the module's band, so a
    swarm arrives as a swarm rather than as a line of aircraft down one axis
    that one gunner can work along.

    IT GIVES UP. UAS_SWARM_TIMEOUT and the airframe deletes itself - a drone
    that lost its aim to terrain and is circling a hillside forever is a leak.

Parameters:
    0: Airframe class <STRING>
    1: Side <SIDE>
    2: Target position ATL <ARRAY>
    3: Nearest it may spawn, m <NUMBER>
    4: Furthest it may spawn, m <NUMBER>

Returns:
    Whether it got airborne <BOOL>
