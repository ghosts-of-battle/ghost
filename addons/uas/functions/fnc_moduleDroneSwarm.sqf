Function: ghost_uas_fnc_moduleDroneSwarm

Description:
    A swarm, launched where you place it: two to twelve airframes, either diving
    on the module or circling it.

    IT IS NOT A PATROL AND DOES NOT PRETEND TO BE. FUNC(moduleDronePatrol) keeps
    a standing presence over ground, replaces losses and stands down when nobody
    is near. This is an event: it launches once when the module fires, and what
    it launches is gone when it is gone. Placing one in Zeus is how you drop a
    swarm on somebody now, this minute.

    TWO ACTIONS, and they want different airframes.

      IMPACT   every drone dives on the module's position and detonates. A
               one-way weapon: the counterplay is shooting them down on the way
               in, and each one you hit is one that does not arrive. Any
               airframe will do because the airframe is the warhead.

      CIRCLE   every drone orbits the module at height with its crew and its
               weapons, which is only worth doing with something armed. They are
               left to their own AI once they are up: what a gun drone does with
               a target is the gun drone's business.

    THE AIRFRAME LIST IS A SETTING. QGVAR(swarmClasses) is what a mission may
    field; the module's picker is how you choose from it. A class that is not on
    the list is refused at placement rather than at launch - the person who typed
    it is standing there.

Parameters:
    0: The module logic <OBJECT>
    1: Synchronised units <ARRAY>
    2: Activated <BOOL>

Returns:
    None
