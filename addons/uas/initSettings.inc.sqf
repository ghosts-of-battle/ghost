// WHAT IS LEFT AFTER THE MODULE TOOK ITS SHARE. One module is one patrol and
// carries its own side, airframe, count and artillery - so what remains here is
// only the supply economy, which is genuinely map-wide: caches belong to a side
// rather than to a patrol, and an outage thins every patrol that side has.
//
// ghost_moduleUAS's ceilings and per-side airframe fields are gone entirely. A
// patrol's size is the number on its own module now, which is the question
// "how many drones over THIS ground" rather than "how many does this side own".
//
// ALL SERVER-SIDE.
