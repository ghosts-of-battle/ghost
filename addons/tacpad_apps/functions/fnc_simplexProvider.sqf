Function: ghost_tacpad_apps_fnc_simplexProvider

Description:
    Registers Simplex Support Services as a TAC//SUPPORT provider.

    ONE BOARD, NOT TWO. DIVINER rebuilt TAC//SUPPORT as a board over Simplex
    because ALiVE's combat support had gone and Simplex was what was left. Both
    exist here, and two SUPPORT apps would be a worse answer than either. So
    Simplex arrives the way ghost's own CAS module arrives: as three pieces of
    code under a prefix in EGVAR(adapter_alive,providers), merged into
    EFUNC(adapter_alive,supportAssets) alongside ALiVE's ATO and NEO assets.

    THE SEAM RUNS BOTH WAYS. This file names sss_* symbols and no ALiVE symbol;
    the adapter names ALiVE symbols and no sss_* one. Neither learns the other's
    vocabulary, which is the whole point of the registry - see
    EFUNC(adapter_alive,supportAssets) for the reasoning.

    TASKING HANDS OFF TO SIMPLEX'S OWN GUI. Simplex's request flow is a screen
    of its own with its own rules about what may be asked for; reimplementing it
    against the adapter's task vocabulary would be a second implementation of
    somebody else's mod. Pressing a Simplex row on the board opens that screen.

Parameters:
    None.

Returns:
    Nothing.
