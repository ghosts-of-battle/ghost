 * WEATHER, full size: the condition as a glyph and a word, the numbers behind
 * it, and the three lines a patrol actually plans against - light, visibility
 * and wind.
 *
 * IT READS THE ENGINE AND NOTHING ELSE. Every figure here is a scripting command
 * on the local machine, so there is no source that can disagree with the tile
 * and nothing to keep in sync - the tile and this are two renderings of one
 * read, which is why they share FUNC(tileData)'s condition rules.
 *
 * FIRST AND LAST LIGHT are the honest names. Arma gives sunrise and sunset, and
 * a patrol leaving before dawn cares about the moment there is enough light to
 * move, not the moment the disc clears the horizon - but the engine does not
 * model civil twilight, so these are labelled for what they are.
 *
 * Arguments (app handler):
 * 0: Map display <DISPLAY>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * None
