/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * EW SCANNER, full size: everything the hand-held hears, on one page.
 *
 * ONE PAGE, NOT THREE. The archived device suite split the same reading across a
 * drone page, a jamming page and a mesh page, and the DRONES and JAM tiles here
 * still each open their own screen - which is right for a tile, because a tile
 * answers one question. This is the other thing a scanner is for: the whole
 * spectrum picture at once, when what you want to know is not "how bad is the
 * jamming" but "what is going on around me".
 *
 * IT PRESENTS, IT DOES NOT MEASURE. Every number comes from
 * EFUNC(hacking,scannerRead) - the same sweep, on the same cache, that the tile
 * band and the drone screen read - so no two screens in the suite can disagree
 * about what is overhead. The alarms are the hacking addon's roster and the
 * alert log is ghost_common's bus; this owns neither.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Map display <DISPLAY>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * None
 *
 * Public: No
