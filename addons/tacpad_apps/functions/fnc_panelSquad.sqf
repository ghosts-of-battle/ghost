/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * The squad rail: one row per man, a health swatch, and the number that swatch
 * is standing for. Under them, the way into the full roster, and the legend that
 * says what the four colours mean.
 *
 * Hue is the data here and nowhere else in the suite - green up, amber wounded,
 * grey unconscious, black killed or off the net. A player scanning this rail is
 * looking for the one row that is not green, and that is a job colour does in
 * one glance and a number does not. The swatches stay square, like everything
 * else in the system.
 *
 * ACE's medical state is used when it is there and the engine's damage when it
 * is not, so the rail reads the same on a mission that does not load ACE.
 *
 * The strength count goes in the header rather than in a row, because it is the
 * answer to a different question from any single man's state. It used to get
 * there by overwriting the frame's own title control with a two-span markup -
 * the shell owns that control now and takes the readout through headerMeta.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Body <CONTROL>
 * 1: Panel id <STRING>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * None
 *
 * Public: No
