/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * TAC//MSG reader, built to the design: a net selector across the top, traffic
 * as three-line entries with a precedence badge and a time, and OPEN FULL / NEW
 * across the bottom.
 *
 * A THREAD OPENS IN THE RAIL, not over the map. Reading a report and looking at
 * the ground it is about are the same act - a MEDEVAC grid means nothing
 * without the map under it. Nothing here can send: REPLY and NEW hand off to
 * the full app, because composing wants room this rail has not got and wants to
 * be a deliberate act.
 *
 * THE TAB CARRIES ITS OWN COUNT. The design puts the unread number in the tab -
 * CMD 3, MED 1 - because the point of a net selector is deciding which net to
 * look at, and a selector that will not say where the traffic is makes you open
 * all five to find out.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Body <CONTROL>
 * 1: Panel id <STRING>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * None
 *
 * Public: No
