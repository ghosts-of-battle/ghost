/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * Every change the timer can be asked for, in one place: start, stop, reset, and
 * moving the countdown mark.
 *
 * THE RING IS ARMED, NOT POLLED. A countdown that only went off while somebody
 * had the map open would be a countdown you cannot trust, and a per-frame handler
 * running for twenty minutes to notice one moment is twenty minutes of nothing.
 * Starting a countdown schedules the ring; stopping or resetting invalidates it
 * by bumping a token the waiter checks when it fires.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: What to do - "toggle", "reset", "step" <STRING>
 * 1: Seconds to move the mark by, for "step" <NUMBER> (optional, default 0)
 *
 * Return Value:
 * None
 *
 * Example:
 * ["step", 300] call ghost_tacpad_apps_fnc_timerSet
 *
 * Public: No
