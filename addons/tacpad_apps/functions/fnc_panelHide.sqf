 * Author: Ghost
 * HIDE ALL, and the SHOW ALL that undoes it. The one panel the master switch
 * does not take with it.
 *
 * IT IS ITS OWN PANEL BECAUSE OF WHAT IT SURVIVES. It was a cell in the settings
 * strip, and the strip had to be pinned for it - so hiding the suite left a
 * settings button on the map with nothing left to configure, and the one thing
 * a player wanted off screen was the thing that stayed. Split, HIDE ALL takes
 * the gear with everything else and leaves exactly one control behind.
 *
 * SHOW ALL is drawn in the accent, because when it is the only thing on the map
 * it has to be found without hunting.
 *
 * NO TITLE BAR. The panel is registered chromeless, so what is on screen is the
 * cell and its outline - a header reading PANELS over a cell reading HIDE ALL
 * was a label for a label, and on a strip this short the bar was half of it.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Body <CONTROL>
 * 1: Panel id <STRING>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * None
 *
 * Public: No
