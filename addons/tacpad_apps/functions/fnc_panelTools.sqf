/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * The MAP TOOLS strip, restyled into the tacpad and put back on the vanilla map.
 * A four-across grid of outlined cells. Each is a TOGGLE: press to start, press
 * again to stop, and the running one inverts to an ink fill so the strip says
 * what is on. OFF is the one accent-outlined cell and stops whatever is.
 *
 * IT DOES NOT REIMPLEMENT THE TOOLS. Compass, distance, terrain profile, line
 * of sight, building marking, grid placement and find-flat are PLP Map Tools
 * Remastered's, and they stay PLP's - this is a front end that calls them and
 * nothing more. No PLP code is copied into ghost, which is both the licensing
 * answer and the maintenance one: their mod updates and this keeps working.
 *
 * With PLP absent those buttons draw dimmed and the header says so. It is a
 * front end for a mod that may not be loaded, so that is a state, not a fault.
 *
 * TWO CELLS ARE OURS AND ALWAYS WORK. CENTRE puts the map back on the player,
 * and OFF stops whatever tool is running. Neither asks PLP for anything, so
 * neither dims with it - a strip on which every button is dead is a strip a
 * player stops looking at.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Body <CONTROL>
 * 1: Panel id <STRING>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * None
 *
 * Public: No
