/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * The mission's own colour presets, read out of its config.
 *
 * THE SIX SHIPPED SCHEMES ARE THE MOD'S AND STAY THE MOD'S. A unit that wants
 * its own colours on the tacpad had one way to get them - three swatch strips
 * and a custom scheme every player had to reassemble by hand - which is not a
 * preset, it is a colouring exercise. This reads a row of ready-made ones out
 * of the MISSION, so a unit palette is an edit to
 * config\config_tacpad.hpp and nothing else: no mod rebuild, and every player
 * in that mission gets the same list.
 *
 * A mission preset IS the custom scheme. Pressing one writes the three custom
 * tokens and switches to `custom`, so nothing downstream - FUNC(theme), the
 * cache key, the CBA setting - learns a seventh scheme name that would then
 * mean nothing in a mission that does not define it.
 *
 * Read ONCE per mission and kept. Mission config cannot change while the
 * mission runs, and the settings screen redraws on every press.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * None
 *
 * Return Value:
 * The presets, in config order <ARRAY>
 *   0: Label <STRING>
 *   1: Ground as "#RRGGBB" <STRING>
 *   2: Ink as "#RRGGBB" <STRING>
 *   3: Accent as "#RRGGBB" <STRING>
 *
 * Example:
 * private _presets = call ghost_tacpad_apps_fnc_missionSchemes
 *
 * Public: No
