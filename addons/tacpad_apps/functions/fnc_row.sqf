#include "script_component.hpp"
/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * Draws one row inside a panel body: an optional swatch, a label, an optional
 * right-aligned value, and a hairline under it.
 *
 * Every list in the suite is this row - the roster, the traffic list, the tool
 * strip - so they cannot drift apart in padding, type size or divider weight,
 * which is exactly what happens when three panels each draw their own.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Body control to draw into <CONTROL>
 * 1: Row index, 0 based <NUMBER>
 * 2: Label <STRING>
 * 3: Right-hand value <STRING> (optional, default "")
 * 4: Swatch RGBA, [] for none <ARRAY> (optional, default [])
 * 5: Draw the label in the accent colour <BOOL> (optional, default false)
 * 6: Called with [rowIndex, control] when clicked, {} for a dead row <CODE>
 *      (optional, default {}). The control is passed so a row can carry what it
 *      is about on itself - reading it back off a list by position breaks the
 *      moment that list changes between the draw and the click.
 *
 * Return Value:
 * The row's text control <CONTROL>
 *
 * Public: No
