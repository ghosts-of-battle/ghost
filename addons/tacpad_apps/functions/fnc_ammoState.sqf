/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * How much ammunition a man has left for his primary weapon, as a percentage.
 *
 * MEASURED AGAINST WHAT HE IS CARRYING, not against what he started with. There
 * is no record of a starting loadout to compare to - a man who has picked up two
 * magazines is not at 140% - so the denominator is the magazines in his hands
 * and his kit, full. It answers "how full is what you have", which is the
 * question that goes in a report, and it falls as he fires.
 *
 * The loaded magazine counts. Reading only the pouches says RED to a man with a
 * full magazine on the weapon.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Unit <OBJECT>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * 0: Percentage, -1 when he has no primary weapon or no magazines for it <NUMBER>
 * 1: Rounds remaining <NUMBER>
 *
 * Example:
 * ([player] call ghost_tacpad_apps_fnc_ammoState) params ["_pct", "_rounds"]
 *
 * Public: No
