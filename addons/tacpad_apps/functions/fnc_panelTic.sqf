 * TROOPS IN CONTACT. One press, under everything else on the right rail, and the
 * only control in the suite that is loud on purpose.
 *
 * IT IS ONE PRESS BECAUSE OF WHEN IT IS PRESSED. A man who is being shot at is
 * not filling in a five-line card, and a contact nobody hears about because the
 * form took too long is the failure this exists to prevent. Everything it can
 * work out on its own it works out: where you are, who you are, what time it is.
 * The card is still there in the reader for the man who has a moment to say what
 * he is being shot at BY - this is the one that goes out first.
 *
 * NO TITLE BAR. Registered chromeless, like the three buttons above it - a
 * header reading CONTACT over a cell reading TROOPS IN CONTACT is a label for a
 * label, and this is the one control on the map screen that has to be pressed
 * without being read first.
 *
 * THE ENGINE ALREADY DOES THE THREE THINGS. Submitting the deck's own TIC report
 * marks the map, alerts the side and files the thread on the command net, all
 * from the template's own broadcast flag - see EFUNC(messaging,srvTic). So this
 * sends a report rather than doing any of it itself, which is what keeps a TIC
 * fired from here identical to a TIC filled in by hand.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Body <CONTROL>
 * 1: Panel id <STRING>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * None
 *
 * Public: No
