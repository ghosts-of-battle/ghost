 * One traffic entry, drawn the way the design draws it:
 *
 *     [FLASH] 9-LINE                                            04:12
 *     MEDEVAC - GRID 043 118
 *     6 REPLIES - 3 UNREAD
 *
 * THE BADGE HUGS ITS WORD. It used to be a filled block 30% of the panel wide
 * with the word floating somewhere inside it, padded with literal spaces in the
 * markup - the single thing that made the reader read as a mock-up of the design
 * rather than the design. The chip is now measured off the glyph advance, so
 * FLASH and ROUTINE are each exactly as wide as they need to be.
 *
 * FLASH is the only filled chip. PRIORITY and ROUTINE are 1px outlines, because
 * the design spends its one loud colour on the thing that has to be answered now
 * and a list where three precedences all shout has no precedence at all.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Body <CONTROL>
 * 1: Row index, in ROW units <NUMBER>
 * 2: Index entry <HASHMAP>
 * 3: Called with [control] when clicked <CODE>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * Rows consumed <NUMBER>
 *
 * Public: No
