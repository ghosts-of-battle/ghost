#include "script_component.hpp"
/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * Changes one CBA setting from inside the game, then puts the change on screen.
 *
 * It writes the value straight into missionNamespace so it takes effect now,
 * and hands it to CBA's own setter as well so it survives the mission - CBA's
 * setter is used through an isNil guard because it is not part of the API CBA
 * documents, and a settings screen that throws is worse than one that forgets.
 *
 * Setting several at once is what `_apply` is for: writing a custom colour and
 * then switching the scheme to custom is one change from the player's side, and
 * rebuilding the whole suite twice for it would flicker the map and reopen this
 * screen underneath their cursor. Write the quiet ones first, apply on the last.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Setting name, the full ghost_..._name string <STRING>
 * 1: New value <ANY>
 * 2: Rebuild the suite and reopen the settings screen <BOOL> (optional, default true)
 *
 * Return Value:
 * None
 *
 * Example:
 * [QGVAR(show_tiles), false] call ghost_tacpad_apps_fnc_setSetting
 *
 * Public: No
