#include "script_component.hpp"
/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * The full comms app, opened over the map. This is the only place a message can
 * be sent - the docked reader can show a thread beside the map, but it cannot
 * answer one.
 *
 * That split is deliberate and it is the whole reason this exists as a separate
 * screen. Reading wants the map underneath it; sending wants room, and it wants
 * a deliberate act. A quick reply fired off a rail you were only scanning is
 * how a WILCO ends up on somebody else's task.
 *
 * The quick-reply row is the handoff's six-up, mapped onto the messaging
 * engine's own reply templates - so what the button offers and what the server
 * will accept are the same list. A reply the thread's state does not allow is
 * not drawn.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Map display <DISPLAY>
 * 1: App id <STRING>
 * 2: Arguments - [threadId], "" to start from the list <ARRAY>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * None
 *
 * Public: No
