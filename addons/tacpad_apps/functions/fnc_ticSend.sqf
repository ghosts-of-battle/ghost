 * Author: Ghost
 * TROOPS IN CONTACT - the send itself, with nothing drawn.
 *
 * LIFTED OUT OF FUNC(panelTic) SO THERE CAN BE A KEY. The whole send used to
 * live inside the map panel's hit handler, which meant the only way to raise a
 * TIC was to open the map and find the button - and a man being shot at is not
 * opening a map. There are two ways in now, and exactly one of them knows how
 * to file a contact report; the panel calls this, the keybind calls this, and
 * neither can drift from the other. Same reasoning as the EW gate in
 * EFUNC(messaging,submit): one door, one answer.
 *
 * IT SENDS A REPORT AND DOES NOTHING ELSE. Marking the map, alerting the side
 * and filing the thread on the command net all come off the template's own
 * broadcast flag on the server - see EFUNC(messaging,srvTic) - so a TIC fired
 * from a key is byte for byte a TIC filled in by hand.
 *
 * THE COOLDOWN IS THE POINT OF THIS BEING SHARED. A man under fire presses the
 * button more than once, and now he can also hold a key down. Without one stamp
 * that both paths read, the section files three contact reports, three markers
 * and three alerts for one contact. The engine's own nonce cannot help - each
 * press is a different draft.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Say why it was refused, in chat as well as the notification <BOOL>
 *    (optional, default true) - the panel draws its own refusal states, the
 *    keybind has no screen to draw them on.
 *
 * Return Value:
 * 0: Sent <BOOL>
 * 1: Why not, "" when sent <STRING>
 *
 * Example:
 * [] call ghost_tacpad_apps_fnc_ticSend;
 *
 * Public: Yes
