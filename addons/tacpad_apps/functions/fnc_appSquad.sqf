/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * SQUAD STATUS, full size, to the design: the section as a table on the left and
 * the summary, the dispersion and your own ACE report down a rail on the right.
 *
 * The rail on the map answers "is anyone hurt". This answers "where is everyone,
 * what have they got left, and what do I tell higher" - which is three questions
 * that need a table, and one that needs a form.
 *
 * A LEADER GETS THE PLATOON. A man the mission flags isLeader sees every squad
 * on his side - the declared squads first, in the order the mission declares
 * them, then any other group with a player in it. Each squad is one header row
 * until it is opened; his own opens itself. Everyone else gets the section view
 * this app has always been, untouched - a rifleman has no platoon to read.
 *
 * THE ACE COLUMN IS REPORTED, NOT MEASURED. Ammunition can be counted off a
 * man's kit; casualties and equipment cannot - "my optic is out" is not
 * something the engine knows. So the column shows what each man last SENT, and
 * the form at the bottom of the rail is how you send yours.
 *
 * A MAN WHO HAS NOT REPORTED READS GREEN. It read as a dim nothing, which meant
 * a section that had not touched the screen showed no state at all and the first
 * job of every leader was to ask eight men to press three buttons to say that
 * nothing had happened. The report is for the exceptions.
 *
 * THERE IS NO REPORT TO SEND. A man's letters are published onto his unit the
 * moment he presses them, every roster in the suite draws off that variable,
 * and the platoon view is how a leader reads the lot at once - so the old
 * SEND TEAM ACE REPORT button, and the ace template behind it, were a second
 * copy of a state the screen already carries live. Both are gone.
 *
 * Arguments (app handler):
 * 0: Map display <DISPLAY>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * None
 *
 * Public: No
