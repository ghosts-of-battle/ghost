/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * The gear, directly under the message reader. One cell, one job: open the
 * settings app.
 *
 * It sits here rather than in a menu because settings for the suite belong
 * where the suite is. A player who wants the panel colours changed is looking
 * at the panels when they decide that, and sending them to Options > Addon
 * Options > scroll is how a setting stops being used.
 *
 * THE WHOLE STRIP IS THE BUTTON. It shared the strip with HIDE ALL, which left
 * the gear an icon and a clipped word squeezed into two thirds of a narrow
 * panel - a button that looked like a decoration. Hiding is its own panel now
 * (see FUNC(panelHide)) and this cell spans the frame it is drawn in.
 *
 * AND THERE IS NO TITLE BAR OVER IT. The panel is registered chromeless, so what
 * is on screen is the cell and its outline and nothing else - see
 * EFUNC(tacpad,register). The label came down to one word at the same time: the
 * strip is a third of the reader's width now that ADMIN sits beside it, and
 * DISPLAY - COLOUR SCHEME was two thirds of a sentence in a button.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Body <CONTROL>
 * 1: Panel id <STRING>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * None
 *
 * Public: No
