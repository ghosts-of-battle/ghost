/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * What the four tiles currently say. One function so the band has one source
 * and the tile drawing stays about drawing.
 *
 * DRONES and JAM read ghost_hacking's scanner. That function already works out
 * drone count, bearing, range, jamming percentage and net state for the
 * hand-held device, and it caches - so asking it here is cheap and, more to the
 * point, the tile and the scanner can never disagree about how many drones
 * there are.
 *
 * With hacking absent, or with nothing in the player's pockets that can read a
 * spectrum, those two tiles say so rather than showing a confident zero.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * None
 *
 * THE STATE IS THE TILE'S WHOLE VOCABULARY. The design draws five and they are
 * not decoration: "alert" is the inverted accent block and means answer this
 * now, "warn" is the accent outline and means degraded but working, "stale"
 * means the feed is gone and the number on it cannot be trusted. A tile with no
 * source says "stale" rather than a confident zero, which is the difference
 * between no drones and no scanner.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * None
 *
 * Return Value:
 * One entry per tile: [appId, kicker, qualifier, value, detail, state, icon] <ARRAY>
 * State is "rest", "alert", "warn" or "stale" <STRING>
 * Icon is a texture path, "" for none <STRING>
 *
 * Public: No
