 * TAC//INTEL - what the unit has taken off hacked terminals. Folders down the
 * left, the open file down the right.
 *
 * IT IS A UNIT'S FILING CABINET, NOT A PLAYER'S. FUNC(productPackage) files a
 * recovered entry against the SIDE, so a man who was nowhere near the terminal
 * reads what the section brought back, and a man who hacked it and then died
 * has not taken the intelligence with him. That is the whole reason intel is
 * worth recovering rather than worth seeing.
 *
 * THE CONTENT IS THE MISSION'S. Titles, text and pictures come from
 * Ghost_IntelPackages in the mission config, put on a device by a Ghost - Intel
 * Package module. This app knows how to show a file and nothing whatever about
 * what is in one.
 *
 * A PACKAGE ARRIVES IN PIECES, and the folder says so: a hack yields a share,
 * so a folder can hold two files today and five after the next visit. Nothing
 * here says how many are still on the terminal - that would be the mission
 * telling the player how much more to steal, which is the terminal's business
 * and not the reader's.
 *
 * Arguments (app handler):
 * 0: Map display <DISPLAY>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * None
 *
 * Public: No
