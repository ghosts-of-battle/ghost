/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * The TOOLS button: shows or hides the MAP TOOLS bar.
 *
 * MAP TOOLS IS THREE ROWS OF FOUR, and that is a lot of map to give up to
 * buttons nobody is pressing. It earns its place while somebody is measuring a
 * distance or checking a profile and is in the way the rest of the time, so it
 * gets a switch of its own rather than living or dying with the master HIDE.
 *
 * IT WORKS THROUGH THE PANEL'S CONDITION, not by deleting anything. Every panel
 * is asked on each map open whether it wants to be there - see
 * EFUNC(tacpad,open) - so the switch is a variable the tools panel's condition
 * reads, and the suite rebuilds itself the way it already knows how.
 *
 * Shaped on FUNC(panelHide): a chromeless one-cell strip whose whole body is the
 * hit area, because hunting for the live part of a bar this size is not an
 * interaction.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Body <CONTROL>
 * 1: Panel id <STRING>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * None
 *
 * Public: No
