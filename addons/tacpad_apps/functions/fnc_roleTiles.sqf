/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * Which live tiles a man's ROLE lets him see, read off the role itself - the
 * unit's database copy when TAC//PAC holds the roles there, the mission's
 * own class otherwise (ghost_groups_fnc_role). The same shape and the same
 * rules as the net gate in EFUNC(messaging,roleNets).
 *
 *   class jfoNomad {
 *       tiles[] = {
 *           {"weather", "true"},
 *           {"timer", "true"}
 *       };
 *   };
 *
 * NO CONFIGURED VALUE, NO ACCESS. A tile absent from the list is not his, and a
 * role that lists none sees none - the band comes up empty rather than coming up
 * with everything.
 *
 * THE FEATURE IS OFF UNTIL SOMEBODY USES IT. If no role in the mission declares
 * tiles[] at all, the gate does not exist and every tile shows as it always did.
 * Without that, adding this to a mission that never asked for tile gating would
 * silently take the whole band away from everybody.
 *
 * A DENIED TILE IS NOT DRAWN AT ALL - not greyed, not stubbed. It is filtered
 * out of FUNC(tileData), which is the only place tiles come from, so the app
 * behind it cannot be reached either: clicking a tile is the only way into an
 * app.
 *
 * The role itself is the mission's own record: setupPlayer writes the chosen
 * role class to YMF_role on the man.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: The man <OBJECT>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * 0: The gate is in force <BOOL> - false means "no gating in this mission"
 * 1: Tile ids he may see <ARRAY>
 *
 * Example:
 * ([player] call ghost_tacpad_apps_fnc_roleTiles) params ["_gated", "_allowed"];
 *
 * Public: Yes
