/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * The local player's radio channel, as a line short enough for a table column.
 *
 * BOTH RADIO MODS ONLY ANSWER FOR YOU. ACRE and TFAR expose the channel of the
 * radio in the caller's own hands and neither will tell you what someone else is
 * set to - so a squad table cannot ask, and every client has to publish its own.
 * FUNC(radioPublish) is the other half of that.
 *
 * Neither mod loaded is a state, not a fault: the suite is meant to be assembled
 * from whatever a mission has, and the column says so rather than inventing a
 * frequency.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * None
 *
 * Return Value:
 * Channel, "" when there is no radio mod or no radio in hand <STRING>
 *
 * Example:
 * private _ch = [] call ghost_tacpad_apps_fnc_radioState
 *
 * Public: No
