/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * The live tile band. Each tile is a kicker with a right-aligned qualifier, one
 * big live value and one detail line - and clicking it opens that app, which is
 * the only way into an app.
 *
 * THE THREE LINES ARE THREE CONTROLS. They were one structured text with <br/>
 * between them, which meant the value's size decided where the detail line sat
 * and the design's 9px/11px padding and 7px internal gap could not be expressed
 * at all. Separate controls put each line exactly where the module says it goes,
 * and a value that changes width cannot move anything.
 *
 * A tile never resizes on refresh. The value changes, the module does not: a
 * band that reflows every two seconds is a band nobody can click.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Body <CONTROL>
 * 1: Panel id <STRING>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * None
 *
 * Public: No
