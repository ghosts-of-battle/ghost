// callsign. Empty lets everyone task. Tags, not a role tree - the user's

// EMPTY BY DEFAULT - everyone may task. The shipped "JFO" default gated the
// whole app on a flag this mission never sets: isJFO appears nowhere in the
// sqm, no slot description says JFO, so the app refused to open for anybody
// and a day of "support is not working" was this one string. A mission that
// wants the gate sets the tag; the addon does not presume one.
