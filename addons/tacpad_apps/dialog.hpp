// TAC//SUPPORT AS A DIALOG - the host ALiVE's own tablet uses, and the one a
// real map control actually works in. Embedded in a drawn panel on the map
// display, the map control bled past its frame and fed its drags to the big
// map underneath; in a dialog it clips, pans itself only, and CLOSE is a
// closeDisplay nothing can sit on top of.
//
// The panel geometry lives here as literal numbers and FUNC(appSupport)
// draws to the same numbers - a config value cannot be built from macros
// with commas, and this addon has been caught by that before.

// RscText IS FORWARD-DECLARED, and ghost's copy of this file does not do it.
// `class Backdrop: RscText` fails L-C04 "class's parent is not present"
// otherwise - it happens to resolve in ghost's include order and does not here.
// Worth carrying back to ghost either way: an inherited class you do not
// declare is a build that depends on somebody else's include order.
