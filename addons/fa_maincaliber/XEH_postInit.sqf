/*
 * Registers this addon's airburst-capable tank rounds into the shared
 * ghostfa_mediumcaliber params hashmap. That addon's fired-event-handler
 * engine (installed on "AllVehicles", which covers tanks) picks these up the
 * same way it does its own 30mm/35mm airburst natures — this addon carries no
 * engine code of its own.
 *
 * requiredAddons guarantees ghostfa_mediumcaliber's own postInit (which builds
 * the hashmap) has already run by the time this fires, since postInit
 * execution respects the same dependency order as preInit.
