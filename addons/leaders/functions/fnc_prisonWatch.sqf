 * The capture play: a handcuffed leader DELIVERED to a ghost_prison* marker

 *
 * Taking him alive is worth more than shooting him, which is the entire point
 * of the mechanic: the same leader is one node dead, or two nodes captured.
 *
 * With no prison marker the whole play is off, and that is said out loud
 * rather than leaving players carrying a prisoner to nowhere.
