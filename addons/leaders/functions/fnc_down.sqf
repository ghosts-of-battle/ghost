 * Author: Ghost
 * A leader is spent - killed by a player, or delivered to a prison. FINITE
 * once a PLAYER spends him: nothing replaces him and the asymmetric pool
 * loses its share. A death no player earned goes through FUNC(replace)
 * instead and never reaches here.
 *
 * THE CUT IS REPORTED WHETHER OR NOT IT CAN BE APPLIED. Writing into ALiVE's
 * force accounting is not part of the verified surface, so the honest thing
 * is to state the loss and let the campaign see it, rather than pretend a
 * number changed somewhere.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Leader index <NUMBER>
 * 1: How - "dead" or "captured" <STRING>
 *
 * Return Value: None
 *
 * Public: No
