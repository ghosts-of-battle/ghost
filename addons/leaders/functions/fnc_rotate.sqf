/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * Moves every standing leader to another safe house - IN A CAR, along the
 * roads, not on foot across country.
 *
 * He sits in a building for the rotation period, drives to another town, and
 * hides again. The drive is the part players can catch him on: a man walking
 * cross-country between towns is not something anyone would see and think
 * "that is the network", but a car leaving a house and arriving at another one
 * is exactly the thread a hunt is supposed to pull.
 *
 * The next house is published BEFORE he leaves - see GVAR(nextHouse) - so
 * intel found in the house he is leaving points at where he is going rather
 * than where he was.
 *
 * Arguments: None (per-frame handler)
 *
 * Return Value: None
 *
 * Example:
 * [] call ghost_leaders_fnc_rotate
