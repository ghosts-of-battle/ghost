 * Author: Ghost
 * Maybe watches a safe house: the first player through the door draws 3-4
 * mortar rounds.
 *
 * Ghost's trap is mortars and only mortars. IED caches belong to ALiVE's own
 * IED system and ghost does not remake ALiVE systems - so a house is either
 * watched by somebody with a radio, or it is not.
 *
 * One roll per arming, and the watcher retires when it fires or when the
 * house is gone.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: The house <OBJECT>
 *
 * Return Value: None

 * Public: No
