 * One leader, in a safe house.

 * He is a real man, not a profile: the whole chain is about finding and

 * He is pinned in his house between rotations, carries a phone so his body is
 * always worth searching, and his house may be watched.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Leader index <NUMBER>

 * Return Value:
 * [unit, houseIndex, "up", tier] <ARRAY>
