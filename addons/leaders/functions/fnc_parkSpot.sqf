/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * Somewhere a car can actually stand near a building - the kerb outside it,
 * not the middle of its floor.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS: a house's position is the centre of the house, and both
 * the parking and the driving used it directly. Parking dropped cars on top
 * of buildings, and a MOVE waypoint on it ordered the driver to steer into
 * the wall and keep pushing, which is what "leaders drive into houses" was.
 *
 * The road wins when there is one - a civilian car stopping at the kerb is
 * exactly right, and it gives the driver a path that ends somewhere it can
 * legally be. Failing that, a point clear of the building's own bounding box
 * on open ground.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: The building <OBJECT>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * Position <ARRAY>
 *
 * Example:
 * [_house] call ghost_leaders_fnc_parkSpot
