 * Author: Ghost
 * A leader has reached his new town. He gets out, goes inside, and stops
 * moving until the next rotation.
 *
 * Called from the move waypoint's completion statement, so it runs on whoever
 * the waypoint belongs to rather than on a timer that has to guess how long a
 * drive takes.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: The leader <OBJECT>
 *
 * Return Value: None
 *
 * Example:
 * [_leader] call ghost_leaders_fnc_arrive
