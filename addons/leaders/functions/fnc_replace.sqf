/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * A leader died to something that was not a player - crossfire, a mine,
 * ALiVE's own war - and the network quietly promotes a successor.
 *
 * THE CHAIN IS ONLY EVER CUT BY PLAYERS. A kill nobody earned would end a
 * hunt nobody got to run, so the record keeps its index and gets a new man
 * in a new safe house. The corpse stops being worth searching - the phone
 * travels with the succession, not the body - and his car is cleared away
 * if nobody is in it, or the map fills with orphaned sedans.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Leader index <NUMBER>
 * 1: The dead man <OBJECT>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * None
 *
 * Public: No
