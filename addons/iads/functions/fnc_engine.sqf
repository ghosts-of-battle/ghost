/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * What this build of the engine actually has, asked rather than assumed.
 *
 * PHASE 0 OF THE PLAN IS AN ENGINE QUESTION, AND THIS IS THE HALF OF IT A
 * SCRIPT CAN ANSWER. The design rests on commands whose presence and behaviour
 * were never verified against a running game, and code that assumes them and is
 * wrong fails SILENTLY - a scheduler calling a command that does not exist
 * blinks nothing at all while every log line says it did.
 *
 * THE CONTROL TEST IS WHY THIS CAN BE TRUSTED. supportInfo's query syntax is
 * itself something this mod has never leaned on, so the sweep starts by asking
 * for a command that certainly exists. If THAT comes back empty the detector is
 * what is broken, not the engine, and every answer is reported as UNKNOWN
 * rather than as missing - because disarming a working system on the word of a
 * broken detector is the worse failure of the two.
 *
 * Cached: the answer cannot change inside a mission.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * None
 *
 * Return Value:
 * Hash of command name -> 1 present, 0 absent, -1 unknown <HASHMAP>
 *
 * Example:
 * private _has = call ghost_iads_fnc_engine
 *
 * Public: No
