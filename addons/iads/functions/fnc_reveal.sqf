 * Files what the air defence net can see onto its side's threat board.
 *
 * THE BRIDGE IS THE POINT OF THE WHOLE PHASE. A radar wired only to the
 * launchers beside it is a private conversation: the commander cannot reason
 * about the aircraft, the drone dispatch cannot be cued by it, and no other
 * system in the mod can ever hear it. The board is where this mod already puts
 * sightings - see EFUNC(common,contactReport) - so posting there costs one
 * call and every consumer that exists now or later gets the air picture for
 * free.
 *
 * IT POSTS THE FUNCTION, NOT THE EVENT. The contact event carries five
 * arguments and drops the sixth, and the sixth is the OBJECT that was seen - a
 * live handle to an aircraft is exactly what a consumer wants to keep tracking
 * rather than a position that was true a moment ago.
 *
 * ERROR ZERO, because a datalink track is a sensor holding a target right now,
 * not a bearing somebody triangulated. Consumers that want to know how good a
 * fix is read the error; this is the good end of that scale, and the board's
 * own confidence decay is what makes it stale rather than a fudge factor here.
 *
 * FRIENDLY TRACKS ARE NOT CONTACTS. A datalink carries own-position reports
 * too, which is what puts the side's own aircraft on the picture; filing those
 * as sightings would have every commander in the mod reacting to its own air.
 *
 * Parameters (CBA PFH): 0: args (unused), 1: handle (unused)
 *
 * Return Value:
 * None
 *
 * Public: No
