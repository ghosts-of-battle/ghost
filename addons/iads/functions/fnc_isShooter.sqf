#include "script_component.hpp"
/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * Is this a shooter worth handing the picture to - something that can put a
 * missile on an aircraft?
 *
 * P2-D2 OF THE PLAN, ANSWERED FROM THE CONFIG. The alternative was a classlist
 * per mission, which is a list that is wrong the moment somebody loads another
 * mod. What makes a launcher a launcher is written in its ammunition: airLock
 * says whether the round can lock an air target at all. A launcher with no
 * radar of its own and a datalink feed is the whole point of the layer - it
 * shoots what somebody else can see.
 *
 * THE VEHICLE, NOT THE CLASS, because `weapons` on the object already walks
 * every turret. Digging turret paths out of the config to reach the same list
 * is more code and more ways to miss a turret.
 *
 * Cached by class - two launchers of one type answer the same.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: The vehicle <OBJECT>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * Can engage aircraft <BOOL>
 *
 * Example:
 * private _yes = [_veh] call ghost_iads_fnc_isShooter
 *
 * Public: No
