/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * Reads the module and arms the net. PLACING THE MODULE IS THE ENABLE - with no
 * module every radar on the map radiates the way the engine left it, which is
 * the base game and a perfectly reasonable mission.
 *
 * ONE MODULE RUNS THE SYSTEM. Two schedulers over one set of radars would fight
 * over the same switch and the loser would be whichever ran second, so a second
 * placement is refused out loud rather than silently doubling the beat.
 *
 * THE BLINK RANGE IS SANITISED HERE, not at every use. A mission maker who
 * types 40 and 20 the wrong way round should get a working net, and `random` of
 * a negative span returns a negative number - which would put a flip in the
 * past and give that radar a stroboscope.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: The module logic <OBJECT>
 * 1: Synchronised units <ARRAY>
 * 2: Activated <BOOL>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * None
 *
 * Public: No
