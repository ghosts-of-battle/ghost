#include "script_component.hpp"
/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * One debug marker for one radar - where it is, what it is, and whether it is
 * radiating right now.
 *
 * FOR TUNING A MISSION, NOT FOR PLAYING ONE, and the module attribute says so:
 * this draws the players a map of exactly the thing they are meant to be
 * hunting for. Off unless somebody turned it on.
 *
 * GLOBAL MARKERS, because the server is what runs this and a marker it creates
 * locally is a marker nobody can see.
 *
 * Updated when the set flips rather than on a timer of its own. A mobile
 * launcher marker will therefore sit where it was when it last changed state,
 * which is the right trade for a debug aid: a second per-frame handler keeping
 * dots in step with vehicles is a cost the mission pays for nothing.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: The radar <OBJECT>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * None
 *
 * Example:
 * [_radar] call ghost_iads_fnc_marker
 *
 * Public: No
