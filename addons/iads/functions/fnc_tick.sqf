 * Author: Ghost
 * The beat: blink every managed radar, and hold the floor of lit ones.
 *
 * TWO RULES, IN THIS ORDER, AND THE ORDER IS THE DESIGN.
 *
 *   1. EVERY SET RE-ROLLS ITS OWN TIMER. A single interval shared by the net is
 *      a metronome - count to twenty, cross while it is down - and a metronome
 *      is a system players beat rather than fly against. Each radar holds its
 *      state for its own draw out of the blink range and then flips.
 *
 *   2. THE FLOOR OVERRULES THE BLINK. Independent timers will eventually put a
 *      whole side dark at once, and a side that is briefly blind by accident is
 *      a side that gets overflown by luck. Whatever the dice said, the required
 *      number of sets are lit - and the one brought back up is the one that has
 *      been quiet LONGEST, so the duty is shared out instead of landing on the
 *      same radar every time.
 *
 * A PINNED SET IS OUTSIDE BOTH. It is lit, it stays lit, and it still counts
 * towards the floor - which is what makes "Always-On Classes" a way to say the
 * early-warning radar IS the side's coverage.
 *
 * PRUNING IS HERE rather than in a sweeper of its own: this is the only thing
 * that walks the whole list every few seconds, so it is the honest place to
 * drop what has been destroyed.
 *
 * Parameters (CBA PFH): 0: args (unused), 1: handle (unused)
 *
 * Return Value:
 * None
 *
 * Public: No
