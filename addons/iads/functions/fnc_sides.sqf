 * Author: Ghost
 * The sides whose air defence this manages: every side the players are not on.
 *
 * NOT AN ATTRIBUTE, BY RULE (D59). Sides are typed once in this mod - Ghost -
 * Enemy names the hostile one, Ghost - Core names the players' - and a module
 * that asked again would be a fourth place to say something different by
 * accident. This derives it the same way ghost_uas keeps enemy drones off
 * friendly commanders: hostility is asked of the engine rather than assumed
 * from the side names, so a mission that made west and independent friends
 * gets what it asked for.
 *
 * A PLAYER-SIDE SAM IS THE PLAYERS' PROBLEM. Blinking it would be this mod
 * reaching into the section's own hardware and switching it off, which is not
 * what an enemy air defence system is for.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * None
 *
 * Return Value:
 * Sides <ARRAY of SIDE>
 *
 * Example:
 * private _sides = call ghost_iads_fnc_sides
 *
 * Public: No
