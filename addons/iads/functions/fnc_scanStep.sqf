/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * One slice of a sweep: up to IADS_SCAN_SLICE vehicles from the snapshot, then
 * hand the rest to the next frame.
 *
 * IT ASKS THE MAP, NOT A SPAWNER. Nothing here knows or cares who built a
 * radar - ALiVE placement, ghost_airdefence, a mission maker dropping one in
 * Eden. That is what keeps this addon on the right side of the adapter seam
 * (docs/new.md rule 4), and it is why the rescan exists rather than an event:
 * there is no single spawn event to hook that would cover all three.
 *
 * A PROFILE HAS NO SENSORS. Only real objects are walked - the same reasoning
 * as ghost_uas spotting with knowsAbout rather than off a registry - so a
 * virtualised battery joins the net when ALiVE makes it real, on a later sweep.
 *
 * REGISTERED ONCE, kept forever: FUNC(register) refuses a second pass over a
 * vehicle it has already seen, so the sweep can run for a whole mission and
 * cost only the walk.
 *
 * THE SWEEP OWNS UP TO ITS COST. Busy time is summed across the slices and the
 * completion line carries it, so "is the air defence net what is hitching the
 * server" is a question the RPT answers with a number rather than a hunch.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Vehicle snapshot, taken by FUNC(scan) <ARRAY of OBJECT>
 * 1: Index to resume from <NUMBER>
 * 2: Managed sides, computed once per sweep <ARRAY of SIDE>
 * 3: Emitters registered so far <NUMBER>
 * 4: Receivers registered so far <NUMBER>
 * 5: Busy seconds summed so far <NUMBER>
 * 6: diag_tickTime when the sweep started <NUMBER>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * None
 *
 * Public: No
