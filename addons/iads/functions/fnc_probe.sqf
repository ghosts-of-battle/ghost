/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * PHASE 0 OF THE PLAN, AS ONE COMMAND: the engine questions this design is
 * gated on, driven in front of you.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS RATHER THAN A PARAGRAPH IN A DESIGN DOC. Four decisions in
 * the IADS plan rest on engine behaviour that cannot be read out of a config or
 * a wiki page. Every one of them was written down as "unverified", and code
 * built on an unverified guess does not fail loudly - it runs, logs success,
 * and does the opposite of what it says. Ten minutes in the editor answers all
 * four; this is those ten minutes, minus the typing.
 *
 * WHAT IT CAN AND CANNOT ANSWER. It asks the engine which commands exist
 * (P0-1), prints the shape listRemoteTargets really returns (P0-2), and drives
 * one radar through forced-on, forced-off and back to default while telling you
 * what to watch (P0-1 again, and P0-4). It CANNOT read a sensor display, so the
 * half of P0-4 that needs eyes says so plainly instead of guessing. P0-3 needs
 * two vehicles and a target and is a recipe, not a script.
 *
 * IT DRIVES THE ADDON PATH, NOT A SHORTCUT. The two forced states go through
 * FUNC(emit), which is what a mission actually runs - so a pass here is a pass
 * for the real thing, locality and all, rather than for a command typed in a
 * debug console next to it.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Command arguments <ARRAY of STRING>
 * 1: The admin who typed it <OBJECT>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * First line of the report <STRING>
 *
 * Example:
 * [[], player] call ghost_iads_fnc_probe
 *
 * Public: No
