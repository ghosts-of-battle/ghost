#include "script_component.hpp"
/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * Puts one vehicle on the net: on the datalink, and - if it emits - on the
 * blink schedule.
 *
 * THE DATALINK IS THE MOD'S OWN HELPER, not three setVehicle* calls written out
 * again here. EFUNC(common,setDatalink) is where this mod decided what "on the
 * net" means and why it sets all three flags rather than splitting them by
 * role; a second copy of that decision is a second thing to keep in step.
 *
 * A NEW SET STARTS LIT AND DETERMINISTIC. Left on the engine's default the AI
 * decides, and "the AI decides" is exactly the state EMCON exists to replace -
 * so the first thing that happens to a radar is being told, explicitly, that it
 * is radiating. The scheduler takes it down from there.
 *
 * THE FIRST FLIP IS ROLLED, NOT SCHEDULED. A scan that registers a battery of
 * six at once would otherwise have six sets flipping on the same second for the
 * rest of the mission, which is the metronome the jitter exists to avoid.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: The vehicle <OBJECT>
 * 1: Its side <SIDE>
 * 2: It emits - false registers a receiver <BOOL> (optional, default true)
 *
 * Return Value:
 * None
 *
 * Example:
 * [_radar, east, true] call ghost_iads_fnc_register
 *
 * Public: No
