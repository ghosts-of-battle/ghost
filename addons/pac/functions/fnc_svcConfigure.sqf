/* ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Function: ghost_pac_fnc_svcConfigure

Description:
    Hands the pacdb service's address and key to the ghostd_pacdb extension
    - from the two CBA server settings (initSettings.inc.sqf), which a
    rented game server can take where it cannot take a file. With the URL
    setting empty nothing is handed over and the extension uses what it
    finds for itself: GHOSTD_PACDB_URL / GHOSTD_PACDB_KEY in the server's
    environment, then pacdb.json in the server's root.

    Server only, once, at boot step 3 before the first request.

Parameters:
    None

Returns:
    Where the address came from: "setting", "environment" (nothing handed
    over), or "" when the extension did not take it <STRING>
