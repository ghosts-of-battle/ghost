Function: ghost_pac_fnc_panelAddOperator

Description:
    ADD on the admin page's roster column: reads the Steam id and name beside
    the button and asks the server to put them on the roster
    (FUNC(adminAddOperator)).

    IT ASKS FIRST, like IMPORT CSV, because it writes to the store and because
    the id cannot be corrected afterwards - a record is keyed on it forever.
    The confirmation repeats the id back, which is the only chance anybody has
    to spot a digit typed wrong.

    THE SERVER DECIDES. Everything here is convenience: the checks that matter
    (admin, digits, already on the roster) are made again on the server, which
    is the only place that can be trusted with them.

Parameters:
    None

Returns:
    Nothing
