Function: ghost_pac_fnc_record

Description:
    One player's record, seeded if this is the first time the unit has seen them.

    KEYED ON UID, NEVER ON NAME. A name is a display string somebody changes on
    a whim; the UID is the person. The name IS stored, because a roster of UIDs
    is unreadable, but nothing is ever looked up by it.

    SEEDING IS EMPTY, ON PURPOSE. A new player arrives with no rank, no role and
    no skills, and with `PAC` that means they spawn with no
    skills at all until an admin assigns them - the handoff marks that DECIDED.
    The alternative is a system that quietly grants things, and a unit that
    tracks qualifications cannot have one of those. Two things are written
    at once because they are facts, not grants: an operator id
    (FUNC(operatorSeq)) and the enlistment date - today.

    IT IS THE ONLY PLACE A RECORD IS CREATED, so the shape is defined once -
    FUNC(recordFields). Every key is present from the start rather than
    appearing when something first writes it: a record whose keys depend on
    what has happened to the player is a record every reader has to guard
    against.

Parameters:
    0: UID <STRING>
    1: Name to seed or refresh with <STRING> (optional, default "")

Returns:
    The record <HASHMAP>, or an empty one off the server
