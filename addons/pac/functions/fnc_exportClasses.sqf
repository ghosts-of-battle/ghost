Function: ghost_pac_fnc_exportClasses

Description:
    Write what this server actually has loaded into <unit>.classes, so the web
    manager's arsenal and motorpool editors can offer real classnames instead
    of a text box.

    ONLY THE GAME KNOWS. A list of classnames typed on a website goes stale the
    day a mod is added or dropped, and a classname that does not exist is a
    silent hole in an arsenal - the item simply is not there, with nothing said.
    So the list comes from configFile on the server that will run the mission.

    ON DEMAND, NOT AT BOOT. Walking CfgWeapons and CfgVehicles takes a moment
    and the answer only changes when the modset does, so an admin presses the
    button after a mod change rather than paying for it every mission start.

    SCOPE 2 ONLY. scope = 2 is what BI means by "a player can be given this";
    scope 1 is a base class and 0 is hidden. Without that filter the list is
    tens of thousands of entries, most of them useless, and large enough to be
    worth worrying about against the 16 MB a document may hold.

Parameters:
    0: Caller <OBJECT> (optional, default objNull) - told what happened

Returns:
    How many classnames were written <NUMBER>
