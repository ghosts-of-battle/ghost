Function: ghost_pac_fnc_adminSetting

Description:
    An admin changes one of the unit's SETTINGS, on the server, checked the way
    every other admin door is checked.

    ONLY THE "WHICH VERSION" ONES. A unit keeps several orders of battle,
    arsenals, briefings and orders, and these settings say which of them is the
    unit's default - so this is how the in-game editor ticks one LIVE. Every
    other setting either belongs to the server (unitId, serverId, sync - a
    database cannot tell a server where the database is) or has its own screen.

    THE DEFAULT, NOT THE LAW. A mission that names a version in its own
    CfgGFA_PAC keeps that one whatever is set here - see FUNC(structureAdopt).
    Read at the next mission start; the one already running keeps what it
    booted with.

Parameters:
    0: Caller <OBJECT>
    1: Setting <STRING>
    2: Value <STRING>

Returns:
    Whether it was set <BOOL>
