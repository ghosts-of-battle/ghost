Function: ghost_pac_fnc_sessionStart

Description:
    Opens an attendance session for a player who has just connected.

    A SESSION IS ONE ROW, APPEND-ONLY:

        [uid, name, joinedAt, lastSeenAt, leftAt, windowId]

    joinedAt and lastSeenAt start equal; FUNC(sessionTick) moves lastSeenAt
    forward every PAC_HEARTBEAT seconds while the player is on, and
    FUNC(sessionEnd) writes leftAt when they go. A server that dies mid-op
    leaves leftAt empty and lastSeenAt within a minute of the truth, which is
    what the heartbeat is for; the next mission start closes such rows at
    lastSeenAt (XEH_postInit).

    windowId is the op window open when they joined, or "" - attendance is
    answered per window, and a join is stamped with the one it fell in so the
    report does not have to work it out from timestamps later.

    A SECOND CONNECT CLOSES THE FIRST. A player who dropped without the server
    seeing a disconnect and came straight back would otherwise hold two open
    rows; the older is closed at its lastSeenAt.

Parameters:
    0: UID <STRING>
    1: Name <STRING>

Returns:
    Nothing
