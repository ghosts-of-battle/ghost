Function: ghost_pac_fnc_applyRank

Description:
    Puts a player's PAC rank on their unit.

    TWO RANKS, ONE MAPPING. A unit has its own ladder - the handoff allows many
    custom ranks and says each MUST name one of Arma's seven - and Arma has the
    seven it has. This reads the player's rankId, finds the rank's armaRank, and
    sets that. The unit's own name and insignia are what the roster shows; the
    Arma rank is what the engine's own AI and scoreboard read.

    LOCAL TO THE UNIT. setRank has local effect on the argument, so this runs
    where the player is - the server remoteExecs it to the owner, which is the
    pattern FUNC(applySkills) follows for the same reason and the reason
    ghost_players_fnc_setRank already does it that way.

    A RANK THE STRUCTURE HAS LOST IS LEFT ALONE. An orphaned rankId is flagged
    by FUNC(storeLoad) for the admin panel; it is not this function's job to
    guess, and it is certainly not its job to demote somebody because a config
    file was renamed.

Parameters:
    0: The unit <OBJECT>
    1: rankId <STRING>

Returns:
    The Arma rank set, or "" <STRING>
