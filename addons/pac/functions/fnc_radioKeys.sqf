Function: ghost_pac_fnc_radioKeys

Description:
    THE RADIO PLAN'S VOCABULARY: every ghostFR_radio_* global the mod
    reads, by the part after the prefix, with the value a machine holds
    when nobody has written one. The structure's "radio" section is this
    map - config_radio.hpp in the database - and FUNC(radioApply) writes
    the globals from it; FUNC(radioFromMission) reads them back off a
    mission that still ships the file.

    The defaults are "no plan": empty channel lists, stock power, channel
    one everywhere. They exist so a bare read (gear's setupRadios,
    players' getRadioChannel) never hits nil on a mission whose plan is
    still on its way from the server.

Parameters:
    None

Returns:
    [[key, default], ...] <ARRAY>
