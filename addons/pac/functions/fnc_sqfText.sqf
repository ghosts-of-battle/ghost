Function: ghost_pac_fnc_sqfText

Description:
    An array written the way a CONFIG FILE writes it - braces, double quotes,
    commas, no spaces.

    WHY NOT str. `str` writes SQF: square brackets and, for a string, quotes
    that are not the ones a .hpp uses. What CAPTURE puts in the loadout box has
    to be the same text somebody could paste into config_roles.hpp and the same
    text the website's loadout box shows, or the three of them disagree about
    what a loadout looks like and one of them is silently wrong.

    Numbers, strings, booleans and nested arrays are all a loadout holds, so
    that is all this writes. A quote inside a string is doubled, which is how a
    config escapes one.

Parameters:
    0: The value <ANY>

Returns:
    The text <STRING>

Example:
    [getUnitLoadout player] call ghost_pac_fnc_sqfText
