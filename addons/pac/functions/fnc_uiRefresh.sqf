    Description: Something the page reads was republished - the roster, the
        structure, the log. Redraw the page IF it is one that only reads: a
        table, the dashboard. A form being typed into is left alone, so a
        roster publish cannot wipe an admin's half-written note.

        A page says it is safe to redraw by setting GVAR(uiLive) true.

    Parameters:
        0: What changed <STRING> (optional, for the log)

    Returns:
        Nothing
