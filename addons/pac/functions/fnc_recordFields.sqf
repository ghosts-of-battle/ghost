Function: ghost_pac_fnc_recordFields

Description:
    THE ONE TABLE of a player record's keys and their empty values - the
    operator record. FUNC(record) seeds a new record from it and
    FUNC(recordUpgrade) fills the keys an older record lacks, so every
    record has every key and no reader has to guard for a field that
    appeared later.

        identity     name (the Arma profile name, refreshed on connect),
                     operatorId (OP-nnnnn, given once), milsimName (the
                     name the unit calls them - "Cpl J. Miller"), discordId,
                     email (OPTIONAL, given by the player themselves on the
                     web manager - never asked for in game, never public),
                     enlistedAt (YYYY-MM-DD, the day the unit first saw them)
        service      rankId, promotedAt (the day the rank last changed),
                     clearance (what the unit lets them do - free text),
                     statusId (duty status)
        orbat        company (free text), groupId (the squad), roleId (the
                     billet), reportsTo (an operator id, or a name)
        logs         skillIds (held now), qualifications [[skillId, name,
                     dateEarned]] (ever granted), awards [[id, date, by,
                     citation]], excused [windowId] (absences an admin
                     excused), adminActions [[LOG-n, type, date, byUid,
                     byName, notes]], notes [[date, by, text]],
                     training [[date, by, text]] (courses held, back-datable)
        the rest     loadouts, updatedAt, serverId

    The pay grade is the RANK's (structure ranks >> payGrade), the platoon
    is the ORBAT's, attendance is counted off the sessions - none of those
    are written on the record. FUNC(operatorJson) puts the lot together.

Parameters:
    None

Returns:
    [[key, empty value], ...] <ARRAY>
