/* ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Function: ghost_pac_fnc_svcSections

Description:
    EVERY CONFIG THE DATABASE HOLDS, in one table - the document's section
    name, the shape it is stored in, and the setting a MISSION uses to name
    which version of it to run.

    THIS TABLE IS THE CONTRACT. A section missing from it is a document the
    game never reads however carefully somebody fills it in on the website -
    which is exactly what had happened to cosmetics, logistics, pylons and
    the AI skill block (2026-09-09): the readers existed, the documents
    existed, and nothing carried them across.

    THE VERSION SETTING IS THE MISSION'S (user, 2026-09-09: "part of the
    conection to mongo I want the mission config to define the orbat template
    to use, and all the common templates used in the mission"). A mission
    names the versions it runs in its own CfgGFA_PAC settings; the database
    holds the default for a mission that does not care. See
    FUNC(structureAdopt), which is where the mission's choice is kept.

    SHAPES:
        "items"    {section, items: {id: {...}}}   - most of them
        "lists"    {section, lists: {name: [...]}} - the arsenal's shape;
                   these also carry named VARIANTS, fetched by prefix
        "code"     {section, code: "..."}          - a block of SQF
        "special"  its own shape and its own fetch - the ORBAT and the
                   welcome screen, handled by name in FUNC(svcStructure)

Parameters:
    None

Returns:
    [[section, shape, settingName], ...] <ARRAY>
