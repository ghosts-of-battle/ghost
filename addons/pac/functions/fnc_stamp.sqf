Function: ghost_pac_fnc_stamp

Description:
    A UTC timestamp string, "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS".

    EVERY RECORD CARRIES ONE and the merge rule depends on it: player data is
    last-writer-wins by updatedAt, across servers that have never spoken to each
    other. So it has to be UTC, it has to be sortable as a plain string, and it
    has to come from the real clock rather than mission time - a mission that has
    been running for six hours and one that just started must still order
    correctly against each other.

    systemTimeUTC, NOT date. `date` is the MISSION's clock, which a mission maker
    sets to 1985 if the scenario wants it, and a roster stamped in 1985 sorts
    before everything ever written.

Parameters:
    None

Returns:
    Timestamp <STRING>
