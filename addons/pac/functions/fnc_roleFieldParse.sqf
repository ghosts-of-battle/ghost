Function: ghost_pac_fnc_roleFieldParse

Description:
    The other half of FUNC(roleFieldText): an edit box back into the shape the
    role is stored in. Whatever that one writes, this reads.

        nets, tiles          C2, FIRES.cas=false   -> [["C2","true"],["FIRES.cas","false"]]
        traits               UAVHacker=true        -> [["UAVHacker","true","false"]]
        customVariables      isLeader=true         -> [["isLeader","true","true"]]
        defaultLoadout       {"arifle_MX_F",...}   -> the array

    THE THIRD VALUE IS NOT GUESSED WHERE IT MATTERS. A trait's third element is
    setUnitTrait's custom flag, and a name the engine does not have needs it
    true or the trait is thrown away without a word - so it is decided by
    whether the name is one of the engine's seven, not by whoever typed it. A
    custom variable's third element is the global flag and defaults true, which
    is what every role in the framework uses.

    AN EXISTING ROW KEEPS ITS THIRD VALUE. A role that deliberately set a
    variable local, or a trait custom against the rule, is not corrected by
    somebody editing the list - the old rows are passed in and matched by name.

Parameters:
    0: Field name <STRING>
    1: The text <STRING>
    2: The rows as they are now <ARRAY> (optional) - to keep third values

Returns:
    The value to store <ANY>
