Function: ghost_pac_fnc_adminSave

Description:
    SAVE on the admin page: force-writes the store to every backend now -
    the profile, and the service when one is up - past the debounce, and
    re-publishes the roster so every client (the edited player included)
    reapplies rank and skills at once. Server only, admin-checked.

    WHY, WHEN EDITS ALREADY SAVE. Each edit (a rank combo, a skill tick)
    writes through FUNC(adminSet), but the disk write is debounced thirty
    seconds so a run down the roster is one write, not thirty. SAVE is the
    "I am done, put it down now" button: it makes the last edits durable
    immediately and confirms it, rather than an admin wondering whether the
    change stuck (user, 2026-09-05).

Parameters:
    0: Caller <OBJECT>

Returns:
    Whether it wrote <BOOL>
