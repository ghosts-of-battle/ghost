Function: ghost_pac_fnc_sessionSkills

Description:
    Gives a player skills for THIS mission only - what the admin panel's
    Player Skills box applies.

    THE OP, NOT THE RECORD (user, 2026-10-07: "whats done in admin is for that
    op/game only ... for it to be permanent it needs to be in pac"). The list
    is kept on the server by Steam id in GVAR(session) and published, so a
    respawn or a rejoin keeps it until the mission ends. It is never written
    to the database: a permanent skill is set on the PAC record.

    The effects are FUNC(applySkills)'s strings plus "skill:<id>", which
    applies that skill whole - its effects, its arsenal list and its tag - as
    if the man held it. An empty list ends his session skills.

    SERVER ONLY, admins only - the caller is checked here, not trusted.

Parameters:
    0: Caller <OBJECT> - the admin
    1: Target <OBJECT> - the player
    2: Effects <ARRAY of STRING>

Returns:
    Whether it was applied <BOOL>
