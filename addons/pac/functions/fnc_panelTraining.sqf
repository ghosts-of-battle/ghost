Function: ghost_pac_fnc_panelTraining

Description:
    The TRAINING block on the player page (user, 2026-09-05: "add a
    training section - date, time and notes").

    ADD sends the course picked in the dropdown - the unit's catalogue, the
    "trainings" structure section - with whatever is in the box beside it;
    the server stamps it with the time and the admin's name. To back-date a
    course, start the box with the day it was held, YYYY-MM-DD, and the
    server takes that as the date; the rest of the box is the note:

        2026-08-14 passed

    A unit with no catalogue yet can type the course into the box instead
    (user, 2026-09-05: "a config doc in storage and a drop down to select
    the training").

    REMOVE takes out the selected row. The rows carry their index into the
    record's own list, so the newest-first display and the stored order
    never disagree about which entry is meant.

Parameters:
    0: Mode <STRING> - "add" | "remove"

Returns:
    Nothing
