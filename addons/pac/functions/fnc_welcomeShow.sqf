Function: ghost_pac_fnc_welcomeShow

Description:
    The welcome panel, from the database if the unit has written one, from the
    mission's config if not.

    ONE CALL FOR THE MISSION. initPlayerLocal.sqf used to read
    missionConfigFile >> "GHOSTFR_Welcome" itself and hand it to the modal.
    That is fine while the text lives in the mission, and impossible once it
    lives in the database - a mission cannot know whether a document exists.
    So the mission calls this instead and the mod decides where the text came
    from; a mission that ships no config folder and one that ships a full one
    both call the same line.

    THE DATABASE WINS, BUT ONLY IF IT HAS SOMETHING. An empty or absent
    <unit>.welcome leaves the mission's own class in charge, so turning the
    template on is additive and nothing breaks the day the database is empty.

    THE TEXT IS WRITTEN, NOT ASSEMBLED (user, 2026-09-09: "instead of all this
    crap how about a simple editor that you can insert returns and set the html
    stuff arma uses"). "text" is one block of Arma structured text - the
    writer's own returns and his own <t>, <br/>, <img> and <a> tags - and it is
    handed to the panel as a single line, so the tags do the work the per-line
    size/colour/align records used to. The returns become <br/> here because a
    real newline in structured text is not a line break.

    A welcome that predates this has "lines" instead and still draws: the two
    are read in the same place and "text" wins when both are set.

    IT WAITS FOR THE MISSION DISPLAY, because the modal draws on display 46 and
    this can be called while the loading screen is still up.

Parameters:
    None

Returns:
    Nothing
