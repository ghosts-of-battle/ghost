Function: ghost_pac_fnc_adminAddOperator

Description:
    Puts somebody on the roster who has never joined the server.

    WHY THIS EXISTS. A record is created the first time a player connects
    (FUNC(record), from the connect handler). That is right for a unit that
    recruits from the people already playing, and wrong for one that enlists
    somebody on Discord on Tuesday and wants them on the roster before
    Saturday's operation. Until now the only way in was the CSV import, which
    means editing a file in the mission and a restart.

    IT IS FUNC(record) THAT CREATES IT, NOT THIS. FUNC(record) is documented as
    the only place a record is made, so the shape is defined once. This
    function checks the caller and the id, then asks for the record - the same
    call the connect handler makes, so a player added here and a player who
    walked in are the same kind of thing afterwards.

    NOTHING IS GRANTED. The record arrives empty but for an operator id and
    today's enlistment date, exactly as a first connect would leave it. Rank,
    role and skills are an admin's decision, made on the player page.

    KEYED ON THE STEAM ID, which is what getPlayerUID returns and what the
    whole store is keyed on. A typo here creates a record nobody will ever
    match, so the id is checked for digits and its length is reported back
    rather than silently accepted.

Parameters:
    0: Caller <OBJECT>
    1: Steam id <STRING> - digits, 17 of them for a real account
    2: Name <STRING> (optional, default "")

Returns:
    Whether a record was created <BOOL>
