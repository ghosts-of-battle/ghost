Function: ghost_pac_fnc_storeLoad

Description:
    Reads the store out of the server's profileNamespace - always the store;
    the service (boot step 5) may replace it with the database's copy.

    SERVER ONLY, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE SECURITY MODEL. Clients never write
    player data - they ask the server through remoteExec and the server
    re-checks who is asking. A client that loaded this would be reading its own
    profile and believing it, which is how a roster gets rewritten by whoever
    edits a file on their own machine.

    FOUR KEYS, NAMED BY THE HANDOFF. They are the backup format as much as the
    runtime one - an export is these keys, an import writes them back - so they
    are not ours to rename for tidiness.

    A MISSING STORE IS A NEW UNIT, not a fault. Everything comes back empty and
    the first player to connect is seeded. The one thing that warns is a
    schemaVersion from the future: that is a store written by a build newer than
    this one, and quietly working on it is how data gets lost.

    NOTHING IS TRUSTED BY NAME ALONE. A profile edited by hand, or written by a
    build that kept something else under the key, is refused by type rather than
    handed to the roster - a hashmap is expected and an array is not it.

Parameters:
    None

Returns:
    None
