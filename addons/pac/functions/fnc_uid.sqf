Function: ghost_pac_fnc_uid

Description:
    A player's stable id for the store - getPlayerUID, with a fallback for
    the EDITOR and singleplayer, where getPlayerUID returns "" and every
    record keyed on it would fail to match (a tester's own record, rank and
    skills read as empty - "storage did not load" when testing from the
    editor, user 2026-09-05).

    THE FALLBACK IS STABLE ACROSS A SESSION and derived from the profile
    name, so the same tester keeps the same record between spawns. It is
    marked with an "SP:" prefix so it is never mistaken for a real 17-digit
    Steam id (a CSV import, an admin list, a merge across servers all stay
    Steam-id only). In a real game - hosted, dedicated, JIP - getPlayerUID
    is the id and this is a passthrough.

Parameters:
    0: Unit <OBJECT> (optional, default player)

Returns:
    The id <STRING>
