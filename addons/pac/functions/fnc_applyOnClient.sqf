Function: ghost_pac_fnc_applyOnClient

Description:
    Puts the player's own PAC rank and skills on their unit, from the roster the
    server published.

    NO ROUND TRIP. The client already holds the roster - FUNC(publish) sends it
    to everybody on every change - so the player's own row is read off that and
    applied locally. Asking the server for a record it has just broadcast would
    be a second message for the same answer, and it would arrive after the
    respawn it was meant for.

    RUNS ON SPAWN, ON RESPAWN, AND ON EVERY PUBLISH. The first two are when the
    unit exists to apply things to; the third is how an admin's edit reaches a
    man who is already in the field, without him rejoining. All three routes
    land here so there is one place that decides what a player carries.

    PAC IS THE SOURCE OF TRUTH FOR SKILLS. What is applied is the PAC
    assignment and only that; the roles no longer set skills (the groups addon
    skips every name PAC owns - see FUNC(managedNames)), and a record's first
    skills are seeded from the role once (FUNC(seedFromUnit)).

Parameters:
    None

Returns:
    Whether a record was found and applied <BOOL>

// the player - see FUNC(seedFromUnit). Rank is sent from here because setRank
