Function: ghost_pac_fnc_sessionTick

Description:
    The heartbeat. Every PAC_HEARTBEAT seconds the server moves lastSeenAt
    forward on every open session whose player is still here. Its whole
    purpose is the server that dies without a disconnect: those rows keep an
    empty leftAt, and lastSeenAt is then within a minute of when the player
    was actually last on.

    A player found on the server with no open session - the connect event was
    missed somehow - gets one now, so attendance is never silently short.

    IT WRITES NOTHING (user, 2026-09-05: "write only on edit"). The rows are
    kept in memory and go out with the next save something else asks for -
    a connect, a disconnect, an admin's edit, a window stopped, the mission
    ending. A server that dies between two of those loses the minutes since
    the last one on its open sessions, and that is the trade.

    Runs from a plain spawn loop in XEH_postInit; vanilla plumbing.

Parameters:
    None

Returns:
    How many sessions were touched <NUMBER>
