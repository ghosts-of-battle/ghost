Function: ghost_pac_fnc_bootFail

Description:
    The database was required and did not answer. Say so, unmissably, and stop
    pretending the mission is configured.

    WHY REFUSING BEATS CARRYING ON. A mission whose config lives in the
    database has no arsenal, no nets, no roles and no ranks without it. Booting
    anyway gives a server full of people with no gear and no radios, and an
    admin working out over twenty minutes that the roster is empty because a
    connection string is wrong. One loud failure at boot costs a restart; a
    quiet one costs the session.

    WRITTEN TO THE .RPT, NOT JUST THE SCREEN. With `-autoInit` the mission
    starts with nobody watching - the server initialises it at startup rather
    than waiting for a player. An on-screen message nobody is there to read is
    not a failure report, so this goes to the log as a block that can be found
    by searching for PAC BOOT FAILED.

    IT DOES NOT END THE MISSION. Ending it would fight `-autoInit`, which would
    restart and fail again in a loop, and would take the server away from an
    admin trying to fix the setting. Instead GVAR(bootFailed) is set and
    published: the systems that would misbehave check it, and every client that
    joins is told why.

Parameters:
    0: Why <STRING> - what was tried and what happened, in words

Returns:
    Nothing
