Function: ghost_pac_fnc_structItems

Description:
    THE SECTION AS THE EDITOR SEES IT: a hashmap of id => record.

    Most sections already are that - ranks, skills, roles - and come back
    untouched. The ones that are not get a view built here, so the editor,
    the list, the field boxes and the server's door all keep working on the
    one shape they know (user, 2026-09-09: "the game ui and web ui need to
    have the same fuctions same edits").

    ONE RECORD IS A LIST OF ONE. The welcome screen is a title, a subtitle and
    the text - not a list of anything - so it is handed over as a single item
    whose id is "welcome". FUNC(adminStructure) puts it back the same way.

    THE STRUCTURE IS NOT CHANGED. This is a view: whatever reads the welcome
    to draw it - FUNC(welcomeShow) - still reads GVAR(structure) >> "welcome"
    as the record it has always been.

Parameters:
    0: Section <STRING> - a BASE section, not a screen (see FUNC(structBase))

Returns:
    id => record <HASHMAP>
