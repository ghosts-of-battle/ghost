Function: ghost_pac_fnc_publish

Description:
    Sends the roster to every client, as one flat readable array.

    CLIENTS READ, CLIENTS NEVER WRITE. This is the only direction player data
    travels outward. An edit goes the other way through remoteExec to a
    server-side function that re-checks who is asking - a client that could
    write the roster is a client that owns the roster.

    IT IS NOT THE STORE. Notes and saved loadouts stay on the server: a note is
    written by an admin ABOUT a player and is nobody else's business, and a
    loadout is several kilobytes per role per person that no roster row needs.
    What goes out is what a roster row and a record page draw.

    ONE VARIABLE, WHOLE, WHICH IS PHASE 1's ANSWER. The handoff puts deltas in
    phase 2 and says so; sending the lot on every change is wrong for sixty
    players and completely fine for the size a unit actually runs, and the shape
    that replaces it wants a client that already works to compare against.

    PUBLISHED ON CHANGE, NOT ON A TIMER. Nothing changes the roster except an
    admin action or a connect, and both call this. A poll would be a broadcast a
    second for a list that changes twice an evening.

Parameters:
    None

Returns:
    None
