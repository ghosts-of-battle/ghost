 * Author: YonV
 * TAC//PAC - the unit, as a player sees it. Four views under one tab row:
 * RECORD (their own), ROSTER (everybody), OPORD (the list and the open one),
 * REQUESTS (their PAC requests, and a form to raise one - 2026-09-09).
 *
 * READ-ONLY BUT FOR ONE THING. Ranks, skills, awards and status are set by
 * admins in TAC//PAC, and the roster a client draws is the copy the server
 * published - see FUNC(publish). A player can look at their record and cannot
 * touch it, which is what makes the record worth looking at. The one write is
 * a PAC request (FUNC(ticketRaise)), which is theirs to make.
 *
 * AND ANY MAN'S RECORD, from the ROSTER tab: tap a name and the RECORD tab
 * shows his published row. NOT HIS NOTES - FUNC(publish) never sends them,
 * because a note is written by an admin ABOUT a player; they live on the
 * admin page and nowhere else (user, 2026-09-05). The tab row clears whoever
 * was open, so MY RECORD is always your own.
 *
 * THE STRUCTURE IS READ LOCALLY. Every rank, skill and OPORD is compiled config
 * and identical on every machine, so an id is turned into a name here rather
 * than the server sending names down - FUNC(lookup) is that, and it also says
 * when an id points at nothing any more.
 *
 * IT IS DRAWN IN THE SUITE'S OWN HAND. The same appFrame, the same drawText,
 * the same rule weights as every other app, because a unit management screen
 * that looked like a different mod would be read as one.
 *
 * Arguments (app handler):
 * 0: Map display <DISPLAY>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * None
 *
 * Public: No
