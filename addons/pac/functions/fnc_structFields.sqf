Function: ghost_pac_fnc_structFields

Description:
    THE ONE TABLE of what each editable structure section holds. The config
    loader, the server's editor door and the client's editor screen all read
    it, so a field added here is read from config, coerced on save, and
    offered in the editor with one change.

        [field, kind, label, hint]
        kind   "t" text | "a" array (comma-separated in the editor) |
               "n" number
        label  "" = kept but not shown in the editor (the editor has three
               free rows; ID and NAME are fixed)

    `name` is not listed - every section has it and the editor has its own
    row for it.

Parameters:
    0: Section <STRING>

Returns:
    The field table, [] for an unknown section <ARRAY>
