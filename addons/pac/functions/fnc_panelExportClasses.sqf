Function: ghost_pac_fnc_panelExportClasses

Description:
    EXPORT CLASSES on the admin page: asks the server to write every classname
    it has loaded to <unit>.classes, for the web manager's editors.

    IT ASKS FIRST because it walks the whole config and writes a document that
    can run to tens of thousands of entries - not something to set off by
    brushing a button. It says roughly how big the answer will be, since that
    is the part an admin cannot guess.

Parameters:
    None

Returns:
    Nothing
