/* ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Function: ghost_pac_fnc_lookup

Description:
    A display field off a structure id, or a marker that the id is dead.

    THE ONE PLACE AN ID BECOMES A NAME. Every roster row, record page and OPORD
    line turns a rankId into an abbreviation or a roleId into a title, and every
    one of them has to answer the same question when the id is not in the
    structure any more: it says so, in a way that reads as a fault rather than as
    a blank, because a blank is what a player with no rank looks like and those
    are different facts.

    Empty in, empty out. An unassigned field is not an orphan.

Parameters:
    0: Section - "ranks", "skills", "awards", "statuses", "roles", "opords" <STRING>
    1: The id <STRING>
    2: The field wanted <STRING> (optional, default "name")

Returns:
    The field, "" for no id, or "(<id>?)" for an id the structure has lost <STRING>
