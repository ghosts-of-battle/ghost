Function: ghost_pac_fnc_structureAdopt

Description:
    Makes a structure document - {structure: {ranks, skills, awards,
    statuses, roles, opords, ...}} as the service assembles it, pac_sync.py
    pull writes it and STRUCTURE OUT exports it - THE structure, on the
    server, in place of whatever the mission's config compiled. Called by
    the boot (service) and FUNC(structureImport) (clipboard).

    THE DATABASE WINS, THE MISSION IS THE SEED. A mission whose CfgGFA_PAC
    carries only settings gets everything from here; a mission that still
    carries the sections is what pushes a first document up when the
    database has none (FUNC(boot)). The six sections every database has
    are required; the ORBAT, the nets, the radio plan, the report deck and
    the schemes ride along when the document has them and the mission's
    stay otherwise. Roles the mission still declares in Dynamic_Roles are
    merged back in after adoption, fields the document lacks filled from
    the class (FUNC(rolesFromMission)).

    The hash is recomputed so the tile and the delta tool describe what is
    actually loaded.

Parameters:
    0: The document <HASHMAP>

Returns:
    Whether it was adopted <BOOL>
