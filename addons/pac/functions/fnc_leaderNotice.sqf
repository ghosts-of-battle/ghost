Function: ghost_pac_fnc_leaderNotice

Description:
    The moment a player takes a leader slot, tells them their METT-TC is
    owed and opens the compose on it. Called from the groups addon at the
    end of its role setup, with whether this was a respawn.

    A LEADER SLOT IS ONE THAT SETS isLeader - the mission's own flag, the
    one the role's customVariables carry and every net tag reads. Not
    `leader group`: the group system hands leadership to whoever joined
    last, and a rifleman who is technically the leader of a two-man group
    for a moment is not a man who owes an estimate.

    ONCE, ON TAKING THE SLOT. A respawn is the same man in the same slot
    and gets nothing. The notice comes at once; the compose waits until the
    group menu has closed and the player is standing, and only opens if the
    tacpad is there to open it in.

Parameters:
    0: Was this a respawn <BOOL>

Returns:
    Whether the notice was given <BOOL>
