Function: ghost_pac_fnc_loadoutStore

Description:
    Keeps a player's loadout on their PAC record, keyed by the role it was
    saved under. Server only.

    KEYED BY ROLE. The record's loadouts map is {roleKey -> [stamp, loadout]}
    where roleKey is the PAC roleId if the player has one, else the
    Dynamic_Roles role they are slotted as - so a man who plays medic and
    rifleman on different nights keeps one of each.

    CAPPED BY savedLoadouts. A new key past the cap evicts the oldest by its
    stamp, which is why the stamp is kept with the loadout.

    NOT VALIDATED HERE. The handoff says validated against arsenalWhitelist
    ON LOAD, and that is where it happens (FUNC(loadoutSend)) - a whitelist
    can change between the save and the spawn, and the spawn is what has to
    be right.

    THE SENDER MUST BE THE OWNER. This is not an admin door; a player saves
    their own loadout and nobody else's, so the check is that the unit whose
    loadout arrived is the one the message came from.

Parameters:
    0: The unit <OBJECT>
    1: Loadout <ARRAY> - getUnitLoadout

Returns:
    The role key it was stored under, "" if refused <STRING>
