// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// TAC//PAC's own logic uses VANILLA PLUMBING, per the design handoff: mission
// event handlers, remoteExec, profileNamespace, createHashMap, scheduled loops.
// No CBA settings, no CBA events, no CBA per-frame handlers.
//
// It cannot be literally CBA-free and still be an addon in this mod - PREP is
// CBA_fnc_compileFunction and every PBO here requires cba_xeh - so the rule is
// read as its intent: nothing in PAC's behaviour depends on CBA, and its
// configuration is CfgGFA_PAC - with ONE exception, asked 2026-09-05: where
// the pacdb service is (initSettings.inc.sqf), because a rented game server
// can take a CBA server setting and cannot take a file in its root.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// THE STORE. Keys in the server's profileNamespace, exactly as the handoff
// names them - they are the backup format as much as the runtime one, so they
// are not ours to rename. The profile is always the store; the service
// (sync = "service") is on top of it.
