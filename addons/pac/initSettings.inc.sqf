// CBA Settings [ADDON: ghost_pac] - category "Ghosts of Battle PAC" (user, 2026-09-05)
//
// THE ONE EXCEPTION to "TAC//PAC has no CBA settings" (user, 2026-09-05:
// "that needs to be in cba, a lot of hosted servers do not give the right to
// create files", "this will run on a hosted server"): where the database is.
// A rented game server lets an admin set a server setting - in game from
// Addon Options while logged in, or in the server's cba_settings.sqf - and
// can run nothing beside Arma. So the ghostd_pacdb extension carries the
// MongoDB driver itself: the setting takes the Atlas connection string and
// the server talks to the database directly, nothing else running anywhere.
// (An http:// address instead means the pacdb service, for a unit that runs
// one; the key is only for that.) The server hands the value to the
// extension at boot (FUNC(svcConfigure)); left empty, the extension falls
// back to GHOSTD_PACDB_URL / GHOSTD_PACDB_KEY in the server's environment,
// then pacdb.json in its root.
//
// KNOW WHAT A CBA SETTING IS: server settings are sent to every client, so
// the connection string here is on every player's machine. Make it worthless
// off the server: an Atlas database user with rights on this one database
// only (readWrite on ghostd), and Atlas Network Access allowing the game
// server's IP alone - tools/pacdb/README.md.

// rented box does not tell you which one it leaves by - a container's own
// address is a private one and no use here (user, 2026-09-06). With this on,
// the boot asks an outside reflector and writes the answer to the .rpt, with a
// verdict on TLS beside it: the plain-HTTP leg still answers when TLS is the
// thing that is broken, so the pair says whether a failure is the network or
// the machine's certificate store.

// from your server, and most boots have no use for one. Turning it on tells
// that service your server's address - which is the whole point of asking.

// arsenal, no nets, no roles and no ranks without it. Booting anyway gives a

// and says so; off (the default, and right for a mission that still ships a
// config folder) it carries on with the server's own config.
