 * Author: Ghost
 * Finds ground worth putting something on - the placement service every
 * auto-sited asset goes through, so "radar in a lake" and "battery in a
 * forest" are solved once rather than once per module.
 *
 * TWO STAGES, because either alone fails: pure rejection sampling loops
 * forever on hard maps, and first-legal-spot placement gives the first barely
 * legal spot. Candidates that survive the HARD REJECTS compete on a SOFT
 * SCORE, and the best of the batch wins - good placement in bounded time.
 *
 * Hard rejects, all off the profile:
 *   water     under the whole footprint, not just the centre - a radar is
 *             metres wide and its centre can be dry while a leg is in the sea
 *   slope     terrain height sampled across the footprint, not one normal
 *   clutter   trees, bushes and rocks by nearestTerrainObjects - the engine's
 *             own flat-empty test does not reliably see terrain vegetation
 *   occupied  buildings or objects standing in the footprint
 *   spacing   minimum separation from already-accepted sites and the caller's
 *             avoid list; blacklist markers
 *   road      within reach of a road, when asked
 *   LOS       must see given positions (a sensor), or must NOT see them (an
 *             inland launcher that may never stand in view of the sea)
 *
 * Default score prefers height and margin over the slope limit; the profile
 * can hand in its own scorer.
 *
 * Anything hand-placed in Eden is none of this function's business - it
 * places what a mission did NOT specify, never second-guesses what it did.
 *
 * TWO WAYS TO NAME THE GROUND. Area markers are what a mission draws, and are
 * the usual case. A ring - centre plus a range band - is what a system means
 * when it says "somewhere about a kilometre off that contact" and no marker
 * exists to describe it. Give one or the other.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Area marker names <ARRAY of STRING> ([] when using the ring keys below)
 * 1: How many sites <NUMBER>
 * 2: Profile <HASHMAP> (every key optional):
 *    "centre"     ring centre, when no markers are given <ARRAY>
 *    "minRange"   m, inner edge of the ring (default 0)
 *    "maxRange"   m, outer edge of the ring - required with "centre"
 *    "footprint"  m half-size that must be clear and dry (default 6)
 *    "maxSlope"   gradient limit, rise over run (default 0.18)
 *    "clearRadius" m free of vegetation and rocks (default footprint + 4)
 *    "separation" m between results (default 150)
 *    "avoid"      positions to stand clear of <ARRAY>
 *    "avoidRadius" m (default separation)
 *    "blacklist"  area markers never to use <ARRAY>
 *    "nearRoad"   m to a road, 0 = do not care (default 0)
 *    "offRoad"    m of clearance FROM a road surface, 0 = allow the shoulder
 *                 (default footprint + 2, capped at 10) - nothing sited here
 *                 belongs on a carriageway, and standing ON one is refused
 *                 whatever this says
 *    "losTo"      positions that MUST be visible from the site <ARRAY>
 *    "losDenied"  positions that must NOT be visible <ARRAY>
 *    "eyeHeight"  m above ground the LOS is judged from (default 3)
 *    "samples"    candidate draws per site (default 40)
 *    "score"      code, candidate pos -> number, higher wins <CODE>
 *    "debug"      drop a marker per result (default false)
 *
 * Return Value:
 * Positions, possibly fewer than asked - the shortfall is logged, never
 * silent <ARRAY>
 *
 * Example:
 * private _sites = [["taor_1"], 3, createHashMapFromArray [["nearRoad", 300]]] call ghost_common_fnc_findSite
