/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * The side behind a side name, however the caller spells it.
 *
 * Accepts ALiVE's vocabulary ("GUER"), Arma's ("RESISTANCE"), the mod's own
 * module attributes ("INDEPENDENT") and the friendly forms a mission maker
 * types into a module field ("independent", "blufor", "opfor"), because all of
 * those already appear in this codebase's module controllers and each one used
 * to be handled by its own switch with its own default.
 *
 * The default is an ARGUMENT, not a constant. The five call sites this
 * replaces disagreed about whether an unknown string meant east, independent
 * or sideUnknown, and each of them was right for its own context - a module's
 * force picker should fall back to a real side, a lookup should not invent one.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Side name <STRING>
 * 1: What an unrecognised name returns <SIDE> (optional, default sideUnknown)
 *
 * Return Value:
 * The side <SIDE>
 *
 * Example:
 * ["GUER", east] call ghost_common_fnc_sideFromText
