 * Author: Ghost
 * Receives an alert on the client, keeps it, and says it out loud once.
 *
 * Kept in a list rather than only shown, because the two jobs are different: a
 * popup is for the moment it happens, and the device's ALERTS page is for the
 * minute afterwards when you want to know what that bang was. Same event feeds
 * both, so they can never disagree.
 *
 * Sorted newest first and trimmed, so a long mission does not accumulate a
 * thousand entries nobody will scroll to.
 *
 * Arguments (CBA event):
 * 0: Source <STRING>
 * 1: Text <STRING>
 * 2: Grid, "" if nowhere in particular <STRING>
 * 3: Severity 0-2 <NUMBER>
 * 4: Lifetime, seconds <NUMBER>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * None
 *
 * Public: No
