/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * The contact a shooter should act on, or [] if none is worth acting on.
 *
 * Every consumer that wants "the best target near me" was going to write this
 * loop, and they would have written it four different ways. Scoring lives
 * here so a mortar, a drone and a director all agree on what "best" means:
 * confidence first, then how tightly it is fixed, then how close it is.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Owning side <SIDE>
 * 1: Position to judge distance from <ARRAY>
 * 2: Reach, m - contacts beyond it are none of the caller's business <NUMBER>
 * 3: Least confidence <NUMBER> (optional, default 0.35 - anything staler is a
 *    search problem, not a shooting one)
 * 4: Greatest error, m <NUMBER> (optional, 0 = no limit)
 *
 * Return Value:
 * [id, targetSide, pos, error, confidence, age, sources, object], or [] <ARRAY>
 *
 * Example:
 * [east, getPosATL _gun, 8000, 0.5, 200] call ghost_common_fnc_contactBest
