/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * Reads a side's threat board - the public way, and the only way.
 *
 * Same discipline the EW zone registry set: consumers never touch the store,
 * so the shape can change without hunting every reader in the mod. What comes
 * back is a COPY, so a consumer that sorts or trims its results cannot corrupt
 * anybody else's picture.
 *
 * CONFIDENCE, not just age: a contact decays from 1 at the moment it was seen
 * to 0 at CONTACT_LIFETIME, and consumers filter on it. A shooter wants high
 * confidence and a tight error; a patrol worth sending to look is happy with
 * either being poor. Expired contacts are dropped here rather than by a
 * sweeper - the board is only ever wrong when somebody is reading it, so this
 * is the honest place to tidy.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Owning side <SIDE>
 * 1: Least confidence, 0-1 <NUMBER> (optional, default 0 - everything live)
 * 2: Greatest position error, m - 0 for no limit <NUMBER> (optional)
 * 3: Source filter <ARRAY of STRING> (optional, [] for any)
 *
 * Return Value:
 * Contacts, best confidence first. Each:
 * [id, targetSide, pos, error, confidence, age s, sources, object] <ARRAY>
 *
 * Example:
 * [east, 0.5, 300] call ghost_common_fnc_contactGet
