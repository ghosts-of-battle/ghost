/*
 * Author: Ghost
 * Files one sighting on a side's threat board - what that side KNOWS, as
 * opposed to what is true.
 *
 * THE BOARD IS THE POINT OF THE WHOLE DESIGN. Ghost's sensors used to be wired
 * straight to their own shooters: the counter-battery radar fired the
 * counter-battery guns, base defense's recon fed base defense's mortars, the
 * EW net dispatched the EW response. Three sensors, three shooters, three
 * private wires, and nothing else in the mod could ever hear any of them. The
 * board makes a sighting a fact ANY consumer can act on, so N sensors and M
 * shooters cost N+M wires rather than N*M.
 *
 * A contact is a BELIEF and carries its own doubt:
 *   the position is where the sensor thinks it is, error is how wrong that
 *   might be, and confidence falls off with age until the contact is dropped.
 * Consumers that shoot use the belief; consumers that search use the error.
 *
 * Merging is by proximity, not identity: two sensors reporting the same fight
 * from different angles is ONE contact that got better, not two contacts. The
 * merged contact takes the tighter error - a second bearing is exactly what
 * narrows a fix - and the newest timestamp.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Owning side - whose board this is <SIDE>. sideUnknown means the sensor has
 *    no side of its own (a counter-battery radar serving a coalition): the
 *    sighting is filed on the board of EVERY side hostile to the target.
 * 1: Target side - who was seen <SIDE>
 * 2: Believed position, AGL <ARRAY> - the frame is AGL because every consumer
 *    is ground-referenced: fire missions and spawns all take
 *    world positions. Sensors working in ASL convert before posting.
 * 3: Position error, m - 0 for an exact sighting <NUMBER>
 * 4: Source tag, for consumers that care how it was seen <STRING>
 *    ("ew", "cb", "recon", "radar", "visual")
 * 5: Object, when the sensor saw a specific one <OBJECT> (optional)
 *
 * Return Value:
 * The contact id, "" if refused <STRING>
 *
 * Example:
 * [east, west, _pos, 150, "ew"] call ghost_common_fnc_contactReport
