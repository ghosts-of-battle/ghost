"""Every knob must have a reader. Fails the build when one does not.

    python tools/check_plumbing.py

The failure mode this exists for: a module attribute or CBA setting that is
declared, documented and shown to the mission maker - and read by NOTHING.
Four of the old Site module's eight types were exactly that, and they were
found by a person tripping over them. This finds them mechanically.

Two sweeps:

  1. MODULE ATTRIBUTES. Every `expression = ... setVariable ['name' ...]` in a
     CfgVehicles.hpp writes a variable onto the module logic. The quoted name
     must appear in at least one .sqf under addons/ - via getVariable, a
     format-key list, anything. A name no script ever mentions is a dead knob.

  2. CBA SETTINGS. Every QGVAR(name) declared in an initSettings.inc.sqf must
     be read somewhere: as GVAR(name) / QGVAR(name) in its own addon or as the
     full ghost_<addon>_name string anywhere.

  3. XEH SCRIPTS. Every script a CfgEventHandlers.hpp references
     (COMPILE_FILE/COMPILE_SCRIPT, any init key) must exist as a file. The
     engine only reports this at mission start, as a warning box - a restored
     config referencing per-locality files that were consolidated shipped
     exactly that way once.

  5. PER-FRAME HANDLERS. CBA calls a PFH with [args, handle], so a function
     wired as one must accept an ARRAY first. uas wired topUp - whose first
     param is a Side - and it threw on every tick for a whole mission while
     the fleet silently never topped up. The engine reports it as a params
     type error in a file that looks innocent.

  4. VEHICLE CLASSES AND MODULE CATEGORIES. Every literal `vehicleClass` and
     every module `category` must name a class that exists: one this repo
     defines in CfgVehicleClasses / CfgFactionClasses, or a vanilla one on the
     known list. Two props carried vehicleClass = "ghost", which is the
     FACTION class - the engine cannot read a displayName off it and warned
     three times per mission start. Every module in the mod had the same
     defect at the same time: they claimed "ghost_modules" and
     "ghost_ambient_modules" and NEITHER was defined, so every one of them
     filed itself under a category with no name. Both fields are only ever
     strings, so nothing else checks them.

Names that are intentionally write-only (consumed by an external mod, or a
public mission-maker override) go in the allowlist WITH A REASON.
