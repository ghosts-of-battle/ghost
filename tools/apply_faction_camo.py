"""Paint the factions' vehicles, and hide the ones asked for, in place.

    python tools/apply_faction_camo.py [--dry-run] [--map work/faction_camo.json] [--only faction_china,...]

--only writes (and prunes) the addons named and leaves every other addon in the map untouched - the map keeps
every faction's rows from earlier runs, and a run for one faction must not repaint the rest (2026-09-18: China
alone, "vechicles only").

THE ASK (user, 2026-09-14): "i want the vechicles in the russia faction to have green camo, hide
artic, and sand for arid", "the green hex for the tropical iran and china arid hex for arid factions
of china and iran", "sand textures for turkey"; then "can you make textures ?", "the russion shades
of green and sand need to be darker than the nato versions", "and tyrkey needs ti use Ardistan", a
photo "an example of russion artic vechicle camo" and two images "example of the chinise camo's for
vechicles"; then a Turkish Leopard 2 photo "as an example of arid camo for turkey make sure a small logo
for the turkish miltary is on each vecnicle", Chinese arid, arctic and desert photos, "need russian and
chinise camo for thses D:\\work\\qav\\type" and "eu woodland should be the wdl camos from aegis/atlas. find
or make an artic vertion and deset versions". Read as:
    faction_russia                    Russian Green, made: NATO Olive's hue at 80% of its lightness
    faction_russia_arc                Russian Arctic, made after the photo - and shown again: its hide
                                      (scope 1, scopeCurator 0) was for want of an arctic camo
    faction_russia_ard                Russian Sand, made: NATO Sand's hue at 80% of its lightness
    faction_china (CSAT Pacific's)    Chinese Woodland Digital } every China vehicle's appearance menu offers
    faction_china_ard                 Chinese Desert Digital   } Woodland, Arid, Desert and Arctic; the QAV

    faction_iran                      Hex, the arid one (Iran has no tropical faction: it is CSAT's)
    faction_turkey, faction_turkey_ind  Turkish Arid, made after the photo, a small Turkish flag on each
    faction_eudf, faction_eudf_wdl    Aegis's/Atlas's own wdl (woodland), else made in its colours
    faction_eudf_des, faction_eudf_arc  Atlas's own desert where it has one, else the wdl's pattern in desert
                                      or arctic colours, else made in them
    faction_eudf_tna                  the wdl's pattern in tropical greens: every EU faction patterned while the
                                      US factions keep the game's plain NATO paints ("make eu and us a bit differnt")
    every plane in these factions     its air force's two greys over a light sky-colour underside, the underside
                                      where the model's own faces point down ("by aircraft i mean planes")
    every made camo                   leaves the wheels in their own paint, the wheel faces found from the model's
                                      wheel selections ("don;t camo thew wheels"); Chinese Woodland's colours
                                      from a ZBD-04A photo, its fourth light brown ("the pink needs to be light
                                      brown not pink")

THE MAP (work/faction_camo.json): {"camo": {addon: {class: {"camo", "from", "entry", "textures",
"copy": [[source file, path under addons\\]], "made": [[source, path under addons\\]]}}}, "hide":
{addon: [class]}, "unhide": {addon: [class]}}. Built 2026-09-14 from the
camo pool - the base game, its expansions and A3_Aegis_Public_Releases - taking, per vehicle, a paint
scheme of that name it already has; for the two hexes what CSAT Pacific or CSAT wears on that model;
else a scheme of that name for its model from the pool. A vehicle whose model has none is not in it
and is left as it is.

HOW, the way gen_us_factions.py paints its factions: `textureList[] = {};` - without it the game's
BIS_fnc_initVehicle repaints a spawned vehicle from its parent's list - and
`hiddenSelectionsTextures[]`, under a `// camo:` line a re-run finds and replaces. A texture from
Aegis, Atlas or OpF (APL-SA, like ghost) is copied into the faction's own data\\camo folder. Made
textures (data\\camo\\made - recolours of the vehicle's plainest paint that keep its shading and
markings) are written when the map is built, not by this tool; Turkey's are made once in
faction_turkey and named from faction_turkey_ind too - a texture is found by its path, so that needs
no requiredAddons entry. Files under a faction's data\\camo that nothing names any more are removed.
