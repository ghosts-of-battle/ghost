"""Build the faction addons as NEW classes beside the originals.

NEW CLASSES, NOT OVERRIDES - the faction_mfrc pattern. BLU_F and the rest are
left exactly as their mods ship them; this declares `ghost_US` and friends
alongside, each fielding its own `ghost_US_*` units built by inheritance from
the original. Nothing anybody else depends on changes, and a load order without
the source mod gets inert classes rather than a config that refuses to build.

    addon                new faction      from
    (the base-game US rows - faction_us, _tna, _wdl, _des - were replaced by the
    JTF on 2026-08-27 and their addons deleted)

    faction_marine_wdl   ghost_Marine_wdl EF_B_MJTF_Wdl

MODS THAT LEFT THE LOAD ORDER ARE FILTERED OUT - see DROP_MODS. The dump is
taken with everything loaded, so a source faction's roster holds whatever
each mod bolted onto it; a class from a dropped mod is not built, not put in
a group, and not named as a crew. faction_himf, built from Atlas_BLU_H_F,
had nothing left once Atlas went and is now built by tools/gen_himf.py from
base-game parents instead.

THE ROSTER IS SCOPE 2 PLUS WHATEVER THE GROUPS FIELD. B_soldier_AR_F is scope 1
- unplaceable in the editor - but BLU_F's squads are built out of it, so a
scope-2-only roster leaves half of every squad pointing at classes this faction
does not own. Any class a group names gets built too, at its original scope.

Source data is the in-game dump in the RPT: run tools/dump_orbat.sqf in the
debug console, then this. See tools/gen_orbat_from_rpt.py, whose reader this
shares. While no dump is on disk, tools/strip_faction_mods.py (removals) and
tools/apply_faction_extras.py (additions) apply the same rules to what was
last generated.

# Atlas adds the JSOC sub-roster, and neither can be told from the base game
# by its name alone. Dropping a mod from the load order means dropping every
# class that came from it.
#
# THREE TESTS, IN ORDER:
#   1. A class prefixed with a dropped mod's tag is that mod's.  Aegis_B_...

#      or a mod still in the load order - it stays; otherwise it is taken to
#      be a dropped mod's plain-named addition and goes.
#
# THE THIRD TEST IS THE ONE THAT CAN BE WRONG, in both directions: a mod
# missing from KEEP_MODS has its classes dropped, and a KEEP test that is too
# wide keeps a dropped mod's class. So nothing is dropped in silence - every
# run prints what went - and a new mod in the load order gets a KEEP line.

# ONE ORDER OF BATTLE FOR THE FOUR JTF THEATRES (user, 2026-08-30: "make sure
# all the jtf factions have the same groups").
#
# WHAT WAS WRONG. A faction's groups come from its source faction, and the four
# sources are not comparable: BLU_T_F ships 49 groups, BLU_NATO_lxWS 38, and
# BLU_W_F six - all six infantry, no recon, no armour, no support. The woodland
# JTF was a rifle company and the tropical one was an army.
#
# {faction: template source faction}. The template's CfgGroups is used INSTEAD
# OF the faction's own, and each member is resolved into this faction's own
# roster by ROLE - `B_T_Soldier_AR_F` and `B_W_Soldier_AR_F` and
# `B_D_soldier_AR_lxWS` all reduce to `soldier_ar`. The map is primed into
# `gsub`, which the emitter already applies to every group member, so the
# groups come out identical in shape and named entirely in our own classes.
#
# BLU_T_F IS THE TEMPLATE because it is the complete one of the four sources
# and it is already one of ours - the tropical theatre's groups do not change
# at all, and the other three are levelled up to them rather than everything
# being levelled down to BLU_W_F's six.
#
# A MEMBER WITH NO EQUIVALENT IS BORROWED, NOT DROPPED: the class stays as the
# template names it and the existing roster loop adds it to this faction (the
# woodland theatre has no recon, no divers and no sniper of its own, so it
# borrows the tropical ones and KIT_SWAP re-dresses them - see the entries
# there). The run report prints every borrow. What `keep()` refuses - the
# vanilla armour the JTFs do not field, see NOT_FIELDED_VCLASS - is still

# FA TIER AMMUNITION
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# A faction at tier 2 or above carries the FA round of its tier - every
# vanilla magazine with an FA equivalent is swapped for that round's _tN
# variant. A magazine with no FA equivalent is left alone: FA does not cover
# grenades, smoke, chemlights or pistol ammunition, and most of what a
# faction carries is exactly that.
#
# THE SWAP IS SAFE BECAUSE fa_tiers PUTS EVERY TIER MAGAZINE IN THE WELLS ITS
# BASE MAGAZINE SITS IN (fa_tiers/CfgMagazineWells.hpp). Not because of
# inheritance: a weapon knows its magazines by NAME, through magazines[] and
# CfgMagazineWells, and FA_b_30Rnd_65_EPR_t3 descending from the vanilla
# magazine does nothing for that. Believing otherwise is how a whole faction
# spawned with magazines it could not chamber.
#
# WHICH FA ROUND, WHEN SEVERAL DESCEND FROM THE SAME VANILLA MAGAZINE:
#
#   1. Never one from an fa_antidrone* addon. Those are proximity-airburst
#      counter-UAS rounds - Mk367 PAB and friends - and issuing them as ball
#      ammunition would arm the whole army against drones and nothing else.
#   2. The faction's own prefix first - FA_b_ (NATO) for the US and the
#      Marines, FA_i_ (AAF) for the independents; see FA_PREFER.

#     Drongo's Drone Tweaks fires (the FPV rows of the table: KVN and Crocus
#     left the load order);

#     loadout is lost;
#   * every bag is a CHILD of the source's that assembles THIS faction's own
#     drone class, where the faction fields one (a PLA operator deploys a PLA
#     Darter, not CSAT's); otherwise the source bag as it is.
# By tier: t0 the IED Pelican; t1 the UAV_02 quad + the IED quad (+ a 300 tube

    landed on one of the sixteen, so the whole faction shipped as BLUFOR.

    of civilian vehicles, and the east forces borrow a handful of NATO trucks
    that ROSTER_ADD adds precisely so they can be re-sided - so "they must all
    agree" would refuse to build anything. The majority is a decision the
    roster actually supports; roster[0] was a coin toss.

    The minority is NOT silent. Every unit being re-sided is named in the note
    the caller prints, so a faction that borrows something it did not mean to
    shows up in the build output instead of in a mission six weeks later.
