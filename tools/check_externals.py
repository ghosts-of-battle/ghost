"""Every parent a config inherits from must be present, in scope, BEFORE its use.

    python tools/check_externals.py

WHY THIS EXISTS. `class A: B {}` where B is defined in a DIFFERENT addon is not
an inheritance - the engine builds A with no parent, silently, and A gets none
of B's values. HEMTT catches it as L-C04, but only when someone runs HEMTT, and
HEMTT is not on every machine that touches this repo.

The fix is always the same: a forward declaration, `class B;`, ahead of the
class that inherits from it. That declares B external - "defined elsewhere,
resolve it at bind time" - and costs nothing.

THREE THINGS ARE CHECKED, and the first two are not enough on their own:

  1. The parent is present in the same addon - declared or defined.
  2. It appears BEFORE the class that uses it. A declaration further down the
     file is not visible to a class above it.
  3. It is in scope - lexically, or through what the enclosing class inherits.

WHAT IS NOT CHECKED. `class Turrets: Turrets` inherits the same-named member of
whatever the enclosing class descends from. Where that is an external class -
a base game vehicle, a helmet from another mod - the body is not in this config
and the members cannot be listed from here. The idiom is correct and universal,
and only the engine, holding every config at once, can judge it.

  4. It is in an enclosing scope. `class CfgAmmo { class X; }` declares
     nothing for `class CfgMagazines` - different root - but a name declared at
     the root of a dialog file IS visible to a control nested inside it,
     because the engine resolves a parent by walking outward.

INCLUDE ORDER IS FOLLOWED, not filename order. The config the engine sees is
config.cpp with its #includes expanded in the order written, so that is what is
walked. Checking files individually would pass a config whose declarations sit
in a file included after the one that needs them.
