"""Scaffold one ghost addon per faction we intend to MODIFY.

    python tools/gen_faction_addons.py [--side west] [--force]

Reads work/factions.json (produced from an in-game ORBAT dump) and writes
addons/faction_<slug>/ for every faction on the chosen side that is on the
modify list. Also writes docs/FACTIONS.md - the standing record of which
factions we touch, at what tier, and which we deliberately leave alone.

WHY ONE ADDON PER FACTION: a faction is a per-faction decision - its tier, its
shape, its whole loadout table - and each wants its own file, its own README
and its own PBO. A single "factions" addon would make every edit a merge
conflict.

NOT MODIFIED IS NOT HIDDEN. A faction we are not rebuilding gets NO addon and
no config: it stays exactly as its own mod ships it. Hiding it would itself be
a change, and the point of that list is that we are not making one. The list
lives in docs/FACTIONS.md so the decision is written down somewhere other than
somebody's memory.

A MODIFIED FACTION IS RENAMED "ghost <name>" IN 3DEN AND ZEUS. Once a faction's
loadouts are ours it is no longer the thing the mod shipped, and a mission
maker scrolling forty NATO variants has no way to tell which ones we rebuilt.
The prefix is that way.

EXISTING ADDONS ARE NEVER OVERWRITTEN without --force. This scaffolds; the tier
work that follows is by hand.
