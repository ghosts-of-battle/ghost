"""Make the faction camo textures the pool does not have, and rewrite work/faction_camo.json for
tools/apply_faction_camo.py.

THE ASK (user, 2026-09-14), in order: "can you make textures ?"; "the russion shades of green and sand need to
be darker than the nato versions"; a photo "an example of russion artic vechicle camo"; two images "example of
the chinise camo's for vechicles"; then "on turkey the hemetts color is a bit off", a Turkish Leopard 2 photo
"as an example of arid camo for turkey make sure a small logo for the turkish miltary is on each vecnicle", "for
china a bit to much pink", a photo for a Chinese arid, "chinise artic camo", "chinice desert camo", and "need
russian and chinise camo for thses D:\\work\\qav\\type".

                                         and a small Turkish flag (the photo's marking) on the main texture
Iran keeps the base game's arid hex. Russian camos are darker than NATO's (user); the others take their colours
from the user's images by eye, brought to the game's own paint brightness (a texture sits far darker than paint
looks in a photo).

A texture is made from the vehicle's plainest paint - a scheme named green, olive, sand... before its own look,
before a hex - keeping its shading, panel lines, weathering and markings (pixels far more colourful than the
paint and of another hue). A camo pattern under that paint is flattened first (depattern).
