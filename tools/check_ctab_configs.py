"""Structural checks for the ctab_devices configs.

Written when the addon shipped unrapified and `hemtt check` never opened these
files at all, so "Undefined base class" and "Member already defined" - both of
which have killed the game at launch - could only be found by launching.

RAPIFY IS ON AGAIN as of 2026-08-06 (see the addon's addon.toml), so hemtt now
catches those two itself. What is left here is what hemtt does NOT check:

    idc_dupes    two controls in one display sharing an idc - silently
                 unreachable, no error anywhere
    textures     every texture path named in the configs OR the sqf exists
    layout_hooks the deviceLayout hook is the last control in its block
    scan/parents/root_dupes  kept as belt and braces, and because they name the
                 specific failure better than the rapifier does

Run after any edit to the addon:

    python tools/check_ctab_configs.py

Exit code 1 if anything is wrong.
