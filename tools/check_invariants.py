"""Architectural invariants that must never regress.

    python tools/check_invariants.py

These are not style checks. Each one encodes a design decision that was
expensive to make and is cheap to break by accident, and each fails the build
rather than warning - a warning about an architecture rule is a rule that gets
broken.

  1. THE ADAPTER SEAM (docs/new.md rule 4). Exactly one addon -
     addons/adapter_alive - may know ALiVE exists. Removing it must leave
     every other addon working, and the only way to keep that true is to
     never let a second addon name an ALiVE symbol. The regex is deliberately
     broad (any ALiVE_/ALIVE_ prefixed symbol, plus OPCOM_instances) - a
     narrower list missed ALIVE_aaProfileBehaviour and ALIVE_gridData.

  2. SIDES ARE TYPED ONCE (D59). A Ghost - Enemy module's Side plus Core's
     Player Side derive every side any subsystem needs. Four subsystems used to
     ask for a side five times between them, and every one of those fields was a
     chance to say something different by accident. A new module attribute
     asking for a side is a regression, not a feature.
