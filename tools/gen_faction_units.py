"""Sync every faction addon's CfgPatches units[] with the classes it defines.

    python tools/gen_faction_units.py

WHY THIS IS ITS OWN STEP. Three generators write classes into one addon -
drones.hpp, vehicles.hpp, maaws.hpp - and none of them can know what the others
produced. Each one rewriting units[] would mean the last to run wins and the
other two vanish from it. So units[] is derived once, at the end, from what is
actually on disk.

A CLASS THAT IS NOT IN units[] IS NOT USABLE IN ZEUS. The engine reads the
addon's class list from CfgPatches; a scope-2 class missing from it exists in
config, shows up in the editor, and cannot be curated. HEMTT calls that out as
L-C15-NOT-IN-PATCHES, and with four hundred generated classes it called it out
four hundred times.

SCOPE 0 CLASSES ARE DELIBERATELY LEFT OUT. remove.hpp hides other people's
vehicles by setting scope = 0; they are not ours to declare, and listing them
would claim this addon ships the Ram 1500 it just took away.
