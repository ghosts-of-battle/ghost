"""Give every US faction the same order of battle.

    python tools/gen_us_groups.py

Writes addons/faction_<x>/CfgGroups.hpp for each of the six US factions, each
carrying the SAME 47 groups, built out of that faction's own units.

WHY. The six US factions were nowhere near each other. BLU_F ships 47 groups,
BLU_T_F 45, BLU_W_F six - all infantry, no armour, no support, no recon - and
the three mod factions ship whatever their mod felt like. A mission that picks
"a US mechanised squad" gets one from BLU_F and nothing at all from BLU_W_F.
None of the six faction addons in this repo defined a single group.

BLU_F IS THE TEMPLATE because it is the complete one: 47 groups across
Infantry, SpecOps, Motorized, Mechanized, Armored and Support. Every other
faction gets those same 47, with each man swapped for its own equivalent.

HOW A UNIT IS MATCHED, in order, and the first hit wins:

  1. The faction's own roster, by ROLE. `B_soldier_AR_F` reduces to the role
     `soldier_ar`, and so does `B_D_soldier_AR_lxWS` - prefix and suffix
     stripped. This carries most of it.
  2. The base game index, by constructed name. BLU_T_F and BLU_W_F are BI
     factions whose classes follow `B_` -> `B_T_` / `B_W_` exactly, and some of
     those units are scope 1 and so absent from the ORBAT dump.
  3. The alias table below. The MJTF Marines use entirely different role words -
     `Marine_AR`, not `soldier_AR` - so no amount of affix stripping matches
     them and the mapping has to be written down.
  4. Failing all of that, BLU_F's own class, and the substitution is PRINTED.
     A faction with no divers keeps BLU_F's divers rather than losing the group;
     that is a real decision and it is visible rather than silent.

THE FACTIONS' OWN GROUPS ARE LEFT ALONE. These are added alongside, under
ghost_ names, so nothing that already works stops working and the two sets are
one glance apart in Zeus.
