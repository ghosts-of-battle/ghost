"""KAR_FDF35_V declares its TransportMagazines cargo with `name =`, but that is the
TransportItems key -- the engine reads `.magazine`, finds nothing, and logs
`creating magazine  with scope=private` for every entry on every affected vehicle.

IMPORTANT: reopening a config class MERGES rather than replaces, so the override
has to reuse each ORIGINAL subclass name. An earlier version of this generator
named the subclass after the magazine (_xx_KAR_FDF35_RK_MAG) while KAR had named
it after the rifle (_xx_KAR_FDF35_RIFLE_RK62M2); the broken original therefore
survived alongside the fix, still erroring and double-loading the cargo.

Item entries (FirstAidKit / Medikit / ToolKit) are mis-filed in TransportMagazines
and are already declared correctly in the same vehicle's TransportItems. They
cannot simply be dropped -- the broken subclass would remain -- so they are
overridden in place with a valid magazine at count 0, which contributes nothing.
