"""JCA attachments on the base game's rails - addons/jca_rails (user, 2026-08-28:
"look up all the JCA attachments and edit them to be compatible with MXs and
SPARs").

JCA is an external mod and stays untouched; CBA Joint Rails is in the load
order, and under it a weapon's slots are the asdg_* classes (the MX family and
the SPAR-16/16S/17 sit on asdg_OpticRail1913, asdg_FrontSideRail,
asdg_UnderSlot and asdg_MuzzleSlot_65 / _556 / _762 - cba_jr and the MX Redux
compat, derapified 2026-08-28). A mod makes an item fit by listing it in the
slot class's compatibleItems, which is all this addon does. Read from the
unpacked JCA config in D:\\work:

  * optics    -> asdg_OpticRail1913 (JCA lists them there already - only the
                 ones it missed are added; pistol optics are left alone)
  * pointers, flashlights -> asdg_FrontSideRail AND the base game's own
                 PointerSlot_Rail, both root classes. WHICH ONE A RIFLE READS
                 (cba_jr 3.19.0.260808 and weapons_f, derapified 2026-08-29):
                 the SPAR-16/16S/17 are patched by Joint Rails to
                 asdg_FrontSideRail; the MX family is NOT - cba_jr rewrites
                 the MX's CowsSlot and UnderBarrelSlot and leaves its
                 PointerSlot on vanilla's `class PointerSlot: PointerSlot_Rail`,
                 the root class every vanilla rifle side rail descends from.
                 JCA itself lists its laser modules and torches on both
                 (weapons_f_JCA_IA/config.cpp) and keeps the dual mount for its
                 own M4A4 - that omission is the whole of "the dual mount
                 does not fit the MX". Adding it to the same two root classes
                 is exactly JCA's own mechanism and touches no weapon class.
                 NEVER patch arifle_MX_Base_F's WeaponSlotsInfo for this: the
                 2026-08-29 attempt wrote the nested classes without
                 inheritance and replaced the MX's whole slot table.
  * MRT switch states -> wherever the item they switch from goes. JCA's dual
                 mounts are switchable: JCA_acc_DualMount_black_Pointer cycles
                 into _Laser_Red, _Laser_Green, _Light and _Light_LP, which are
                 scope=1 and so invisible to the arsenal but are what the item
                 BECOMES. Registering only the arsenal-visible state leaves the
                 mount fitting the rail until the moment it is switched.
  * bipods    -> asdg_UnderSlot. JCA registers them ONLY on its own
                 UnderBarrelSlot_rail, so no base-game rifle takes them.
  * muzzles   -> the asdg caliber slot JCA's own weapon slot names them under
                 (MuzzleSlot_556 -> asdg_MuzzleSlot_556, _762 -> _762, 9MM,
                 45ACP...). The 6.5 slot inherits the 7.62 items under JR, so
                 the MX already takes JCA's 7.62 cans; the 5.56 rifle cans are
                 added to asdg_MuzzleSlot_65 too, for the MX (user's ask).
