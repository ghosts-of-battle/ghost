"""Generate tier variants of the futureAmmo rounds.

    python tools/gen_fa_tiers.py

Writes addons/fa_tiers/, which carries a t4, t3 and t2 version of every FA round
that declares a lethality figure.

    tier 4   +6%   peer+, the edge nobody else has
    tier 3   as built - the FA round IS tier 3, so _t3 is an empty inherit
    tier 2   -12%
    tier 1,0 base game ammo - no FA round at all, so nothing is generated

WHAT SCALES, AND WHY ONLY THIS. hit, indirectHit, indirectHitRange and caliber
are what a round DOES - damage, splash, splash radius, penetration. Speed, drag
and the ACE bullet mass are what a round IS: scaling those changes the drop and
the lead, so a tier 2 rifleman would have to aim differently from a tier 4 one
with the same weapon. Tiers are meant to be a supply difference, not a
retraining exercise.

ONLY DECLARED PROPERTIES ARE TOUCHED. A round that inherits its `hit` from a
vanilla parent has no FA value to scale, and writing one would invent a number.

THE TIER 2 FLOOR IS CHECKED IN GAME, NOT HERE. "Never worse than base game"
needs vanilla's numbers, and vanilla's config is not readable from a text
editor - but it is readable from a running mission, where both configs exist
side by side. `#ghost fa.tiers` walks every generated t2 round, finds its
vanilla ancestor and reports any that came out weaker. That is the check; this
script cannot do it.

MAGAZINE WELLS. A tier magazine is a NEW CLASS, and a weapon knows its
magazines by name: magazines[] and CfgMagazineWells are matched on the class
name, and inheriting from FA_o_150Rnd_762x54_Box does not put _t4 in front of
the Zafir. So every generated magazine is written back into every well its base
magazine sits in (CfgMagazineWells.hpp, both halves) - without that a tier 4
rifleman spawns with eight magazines he cannot chamber, which is exactly what a
CSAT autorifleman did.

    python tools/gen_fa_tiers.py --wells-only

writes ONLY the wells files. The ammo and magazine files need the vanilla floor
(work/vanilla_ammo.json) to come out the same; the wells do not, so they can be
rebuilt on a machine without it.

# Not read, not tiered, not required. This matters more than it looks: every
# tier variant in fa_tiers_mods inherits from a round in one of these, and
# the PBO carried them ALL in requiredAddons with skipWhenMissingDependencies
# - so one absent mod dropped the whole of fa_tiers_mods, E22's and JCA's
# rounds with it, and every faction on a mod's rifle spawned with magazines
# that did not exist. The addons themselves still sit under addons/ as dead
# weight (their own requiredAddons keep them from loading); delete them when
# the reduction is done.
# AEGIS AND ATLAS CAME BACK on 2026-08-29 and their rounds are tiered again
# (user, 2026-08-30: "make sure all factions have future ammo"). Leaving
# them on this list is what left 2040 Russia carrying base-game 5.45: the
# only future build of the AK-12 magazine is fa_aegis's, and an untiered
# round is invisible to the faction generator, which only ever issues _t2
# / _t3 / _t4 classes.
# JCA'S WEAPON PACKS LEFT TOO (2026-10-02 - only JCA Land Systems and the ACEAX compat
# stay). fa_jca and fa_antidrone_jca skip themselves without them, and while they were
# required here they dropped fa_tiers_mods with them, and fa_tmt (Turkey's magazines)

# satisfiable as written: futureAmmo sits BELOW vanilla on raw `hit` for much of
# the small-arms range ON PURPOSE - B_556x45_Ball is hit 9, FA's Mk327 HV is
# hit 8 with nearly triple the penetration. Clamping tier 2 up to the vanilla
# hit would make it hit HARDER than the tier 3 round it is meant to be a
# downgrade of.

# against 69 below - so it is the one where a floor means something and cannot
# invert the tiers.
