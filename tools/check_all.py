"""Run every check in one command, and exit non-zero if any of them fails.

    python tools/check_all.py

WHY THIS IS A SCRIPT AND NOT A BUILD HOOK: HEMTT's Rhai hooks can read project
config and touch the file system, but there is no way to run a process from one
(`command` is not a function), so `hemtt release` cannot be made to run these.
Until that changes, enforcement is this one command before a build - or a git
pre-commit hook calling it, which is a line in .git/hooks/pre-commit:

    python tools/check_all.py || exit 1

`hemtt check` is run first because it is the one that catches the crashes.
